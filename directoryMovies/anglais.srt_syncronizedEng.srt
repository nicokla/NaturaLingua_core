At the same moment,
on a restaurant terrace nearby,

00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:03,305
the wind magically made two glasses
dance unseen on a tablecloth.

Meanwhile, in a 5th-floor flat,
28 Avenue Trudaine, Paris 9,

returning from his best friend's funeral,

made a dash for an egg in his wife Amandine.

Nine months later,

Amélie Poulain was born.

Raphaël Poulain dislikes:

19
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:35,872
Peeing next to someone else. He also dislikes:

20
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,625
Catching scornful glances at his sandals.

21
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:45,254
Clingy wet swimming trunks.

Peeling off large strips of wallpaper.

24
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:57,847
Lining up all his shoes and polishing them.

25
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:01,108
Emptying his tool box,

26
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:04,024
cleaning it out,

27
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:07,110

00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,717

Amélie is six.

41
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:53,285
Like all little girls,
she'd like to be hugged by her daddy.

42
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:58,377
But he never touches her,
except for a monthly checkup.

43
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,125
The thrill of this rare contact

44
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:03,461
makes her heart beat like a drum.

Alas, the home environment
has made Blubber suicidal.

66

Blubber's suicide attempts
destroy Mother's nerves.

A decision is made.

Enough!

69
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:06,377
To comfort Amélie, her mother
gives her a second-hand Instamatic camera.

Little girl! Look what you did!

71
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:25,847
A neighbour fools her into thinking
her camera causes accidents.

72
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,562
Because she'd been taking pictures
all afternoon, Amélie is petrified.

00:07:31,614 --> 00:07:34,616
She stares at the TV, racked by the guilt

of causing a huge fire,

two derailments

One day tragedy strikes.

Amandine takes Amélie to Notre Dame
to light a candle and pray for a baby brother.

83

Three minutes later, heaven sends,

84
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:43,300
alas, not a baby boy, but Marguerite,
a tourist from Quebec,

85
00:08:43,353 --> 00:08:45,429
bent on ending her life.

86

Amandine Poulain is killed instantly.

87
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:58,280
After her mother's death,
Amélie lives alone with her father.

88
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:02,371
His unsociable tendencies increase.

89
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:05,866
He's obsessed with building a miniature shrine

90
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:08,124
to house his wife's ashes.

91
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:16,755
Days, months and years go by.

92
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:23,717
In such a dead world,

93
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:27,434
Amélie prefers to dream
until she's old enough to leave home.

94
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:41,116
Five years later,
she's a waitress in Montmartre

95
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:43,319
at The Two Windmills.

96
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:46,282
It is August 29th.

97

In 48 hours, her life will change for ever.

98
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:54,709
But she doesn't know it yet.

99
00:09:54,758 --> 00:09:59,420
She lives quietly among her colleagues
and the café's regulars.

100
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:01,962
That's Suzanne, the owner.

101
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:04,850
She limps a little but she's never spilt a drink.

102
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:08,012
When she was younger, she was a circus rider.

103
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:10,637
She likes athletes who cry with disappointment.

104
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:15,685
She dislikes seeing men humiliated
in front of their kids in her café.

105
00:10:15,738 --> 00:10:19,687
Georgette is the tobacconist.
She's a hypochondriac.

106
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:24,450
Migraines one day, sciatica the next.
She hates the words

107
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:26,702
"fruit of thy womb".

108
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:30,911
Gina works with Amélie.
Her grandmother was a healer.

109
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,962
She likes cracking bones.

110
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:37,422
She's bringing a kir to Hipolito, a failed writer.

111
00:10:37,468 --> 00:10:41,002
He likes seeing bullfighters gored on TV.

112
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:47,557
Scowling at them is Joseph,
Gina's rejected lover.

113
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:50,176
He's always jealously spying on her.

114
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,973
All he likes

115
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:54,978
is popping bubble wrap.

116
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:57,483
And here's Philomène, an air hostess.

117
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:01,527
Amélie looks after her cat Rodrigue
when she's away. Philomène likes

118
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:04,492
the sound of the cat's bowl on the tiles.

119
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:08,486
Rodrigue likes overhearing children's stories.

120
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,329
No, thanks, ma'am. I never work on Sundays.

121
00:11:13,378 --> 00:11:18,088
At weekends, Amélie often takes a train
from the Gare du Nord to see her father.

122
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:22,083
- Why don't you use your retirement to...?
- To do what?

123
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:24,213
Travel. You've never been away.

124
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:29,805
When we were young,
your mother and I longed to travel.

125
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:33,347
But we couldn't.

126
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:36,399
- Because of your heart.
- Yes. I know.

127
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:38,815
So now...

128
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:40,689
Now...

129
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,575
Some Friday evenings,
Amélie goes to the cinema.

130
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:47,282
I like turning round
and looking at people's faces in the dark.

131
00:11:53,794 --> 00:11:57,661
I like noticing details
that no-one else ever sees.

132
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:04,297
But I hate it in old American movies
when drivers don't watch the road.

133
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:12,140
Amélie doesn't have a boyfriend.

134
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:16,564
She tried once or twice,
but the results were a let-down.

135
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:20,440
Instead, she cultivates a taste
for small pleasures.

136
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:23,979
Plunging her hand deep into a sack of grain.

137
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:26,785
Cracking crème brûlée

138
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,867
with a teaspoon.

139
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,461
And skimming stones on the Canal St Martin.

140
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:19,336
They call him the Glass Man.

141
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,131
He was born with bones as brittle as crystal.

142
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:25,630
All his furniture is padded.

143
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:29,011
A handshake would be enough
to crush his fingers.

144
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:31,214
He's stayed indoors for 20 years.

145
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:37,430
Time has changed nothing.

146
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:39,806
Amélie still takes refuge in solitude.

147
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:44,520
She amuses herself with silly questions
about the world below,

148
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:48,569
such as: "How many couples
are having an orgasm now?"

149
00:13:58,836 --> 00:13:59,999
Fifteen.

150
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:05,967
Finally, on the night of August 30th 1997.

151
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:10,671
comes the event
that will change her life for ever.

152
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:15,349
Lady Di, Princess of Wales,
died in a car crash in Paris last night

153
00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:19,309
with her companion Dodi Al Fayed...

154
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:13,858
Only the first man
to discover Tutankhamen's tomb

155
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,987
would understand how she felt

156
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:18,280
on finding this treasure

157
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:22,163
hidden by a little boy 40 years ago.

158
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,248
On August 31st at 4am,

159
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:33,339
Amélie has a dazzling idea.

160
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,923
Wherever he was,
she would find the box's owner

161
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:39,301
and give him back his treasure.

162
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:44,098
If he was touched,
she'd become a regular do-gooder.

163
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,142
If not, too bad.

164
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:56,907
The girl from the 5th floor!
We don't see much of you.

165
00:15:56,954 --> 00:16:01,248
Would you know of a boy
who lived in my flat in the '50s?

166
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,533
A boy? Come and have a glass of port.

167
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:08,130
- No, thanks.
- Come in! Close the door.

168
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:12,302
Boys? I've known so many.

169
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:16,638
They're cute until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.

170
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:18,758
I've known so many boys.

171
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:22,344
- When did you come here?
- In '64.

172
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:25,148
You'll have heard the story.

173
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,397
No, I don't think so.

174
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:29,269
I'm amazed. Sit down.

175
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:33,989
My husband worked for Ladybird Insurance.

176
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:37,484
It's no secret that he slept with his secretary.

177
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:41,493
They used every hotel around.

178
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,248
Not the grotty ones, either.

179
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:46,625
The bimbo liked spreading her legs,

180
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,164
but only on satin.

181
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:51,214
So my husband swiped from the till.

182
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:54,295
A little at first, then 50 million.

183
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:57,631
Off they flew to South America.

184
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:00,923
Drink up.

185
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:06,015
On January 20th 1970,

186
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:08,472
my doorbell rang.

187
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:13,602
"Your husband's been killed
in a car crash in South America."

188
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:16,775
My life stopped there.

189
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:19,993
And Black Lion died of heartbreak.

190
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:22,872
Poor creature.

191
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,493
See how lovingly

192
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:29,584
he still stares at his master?

193
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:31,662
One day

194
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:33,209
I'll read you his letters.

195
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:35,002
No, don't go!

196
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:37,507
You can spare five minutes.

197
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:39,215
He wrote this

198
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:40,925
from the barracks.

199
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,013
"Darling Mado." That's me.

200
00:17:45,062 --> 00:17:46,722
I'm called Madeleine.

201
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:49,773
"I can't sleep, can't eat,

202
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:54,609
knowing that my only reason to live
is far away in Paris.

203
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:57,062
I won't see her until a fortnight on Friday,

204
00:17:57,116 --> 00:18:02,905
when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station

205
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:06,040
in her strappy blue dress."

206
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:10,128
In brackets: "The one you think
is too transparent."

207
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:21,004
Has anyone ever written to you like that?

208
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:25,137
No. I'm nobody's little weasel.

209
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:27,759
My name's Madeleine Wells.

210
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:30,898
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.

211
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:34,441
She wept, right? And Wells as in water.

212
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:38,698
Talk about being born to cry!

213
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:44,112
About your question...

214
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:49,620
Ask Collignon, the grocer.
He's lived here all his life.

215
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,077
Hello, Amélie-mellow!

216
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,668
A fig and three hazelnuts, as usual?

217
00:18:55,716 --> 00:18:58,503
Who lived in my flat in the '50s?

218
00:18:58,552 --> 00:19:02,550
- What was their name?
- You've got me there, dear.

219
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:06,547
In 1950, I was two.
The mental age of this cretin.

220
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:08,226
The "cretin" is Lucien.

221
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,315
He's no genius, but Amélie likes him.
She likes the way

222
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:15,692
he handles each endive like a precious object

223
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:18,939
to be treated with care.
It's his way of showing

224
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,400
his love of good work.

225
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:21,480
Look at him!

226
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:25,994
Like he's nursing a baby bird
that's fallen out of its nest!

227
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,707
Don't ask him for currants!

228
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:30,373
You'd be here till Monday!

229
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:33,578
Get moving, spastic!

230
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,669
She hasn't got all day.

231
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:40,715
Here.

232
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:44,462
Go and see my mother.
She has the memory of an elephant.

233
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:46,673
Elephant Mum!

234
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,471
Thank you.

235
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:09,200
Bredoteau.

236
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,822
Sorry?

237
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,667
It's the name you're after.

238
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:18,124
But if it's me that says so,
it won't count. I'm senile.

239
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:20,131
Ignore him. He's senile.

240
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:23,253
See what he's done to my laurel?

241
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:30,061
His old job was punching métro tickets.

242
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:35,309
For three months now,
he's got up every night to punch holes

243
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:38,857
- in my laurels!
- I'd have preferred lilacs. Such is life!

244
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:43,364
- We all need a way to relax.
- I skim stones.

245
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,571
- You do?
- I'll find it. Don't worry.

246
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,574
- I file everything.
- Like what?

247
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:55,415
Your son's nearly 50
and I'm still doing his book-keeping.

248
00:20:55,461 --> 00:21:00,169
You were still squeezing his toothpaste at 15,
so it follows.

249
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,588
Right. Camus...

250
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:06,633
2nd floor on the right. Brossard...
Brossard was on staircase B.

251
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:08,258
Got it!

252
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:10,430
Bredoteau, 5th floor on the right.

253
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:13,228
They were from the Pas de Calais.

254
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,892
Bredoteau. What more can I say?

255
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:24,337
Groping under the photo booth
is Nino Quincampoix.

256
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:33,467
When Amélie lacked playmates,
Nino had too many.

257
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:49,689
Five miles apart, one dreamed
of having a sister, the other a brother

258
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:51,781
to spend all their time with.

259
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:14,463
Hi, Dad.

260
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:17,478
A new friend?

261
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:20,728
No, I've had him for years.

262
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:24,688
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the tool shed.

263
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,736
There. Let's reconcile them.

264
00:23:31,158 --> 00:23:33,234
There. Not bad, eh?

265
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:42,580
Dad, if you found a precious relic
from your childhood,

266
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:46,496
how would it make you feel?
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic? What?

267
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,083
I didn't have this gnome when I was a child.

268
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:53,754
He was a retirement gift from my old regiment.

269
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:58,267
No, I mean something you hid
like a secret treasure.

270
00:23:59,812 --> 00:24:01,889
I should varnish him before autumn.

271
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,440
I'll make some tea. Do you want some?

272
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,564
Breathe in. Hold still.

273
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:14,366
Better now?

274
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,284
Shut the door!

275
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,368
There's a howling gale.

276
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:20,406
It's hardly Siberia.

277
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,032
I can see you're not allergic

278
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:27,748
to car fumes.
I almost coughed up my pleura last night.

279
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,293
Coughed up a pleura? Sure.

280
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,925
- What's on the menu today, Suzanne?
- Endives au gratin.

281
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,426
They'll have you on your knees, you'll see.

282
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,671
They're good, then?

283
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,930
- Depends where.
- If it's at the toilet...

284
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:40,257
Not good!

285
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,767
12:15, laughs orgasmically
to attract alpha male.

286
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,738
He's going to drive me berserk!

287
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,531
Can't he give up?
There are plenty of other bars.

288
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:58,535
Goodbye.

289
00:24:58,579 --> 00:24:59,824
Suzanne.

290
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:01,781
- Suzanne.
- Yes.

291
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:04,584
"Au gratin" means white sauce, right?

292
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:06,251
Yes, why?

293
00:25:06,295 --> 00:25:11,337
I can't stomach it. Like you and horse meat.

294
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,136
It's not my stomach, it's my memory.

295
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,971
I'd rather cook human flesh.

296
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,054
You're kidding!

297
00:25:30,194 --> 00:25:34,572
Suzanne, would you mind if I left early today?

298
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,655
What's his name?

299
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,777
Dominique Bredoteau.

300
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,160
Hello.

301
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,204
Are you Dominique Bredoteau?

302
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:50,630
That's me.

303
00:25:50,673 --> 00:25:52,665
Why?

304
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:54,793
It's about...

305
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,090
...the petition.

306
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,549
Petition?

307
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:03,343
Yes. The petition to...

308
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,680
...to canonise Lady Di.

309
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,391
No, thanks.

310
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,472
No.

311
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,857
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to bother you...

312
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,991
- Yes?
- Hello.

313
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:30,708
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau
for the European census.

314
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,920
Come up. Third floor.

315
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,300
Hello, kitten.

316
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,888
Earl Grey?

317
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,017
Jasmine?

318
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:55,104
What will you have?

319
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:00,451
I'm working.

320
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,123
There. I'm coming.

321
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,549
Do you know where I can find
Dominique Bredoteau?

322
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:18,881
Oh, my poor dear!

323
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,133
You just missed him.

324
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:24,934
Look, there he goes now.

325
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,433
Bre-to-deau.

326
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,357
Not Bre-do-teau.

327
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,280
You need

328
00:27:40,324 --> 00:27:43,824
a glass of mulled wine.

329
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,697
Come in.

330
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,992
Come on in.

331
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:54,628
I've lived here for five years.
This is the first time we've met.

332
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,460
I never go out on the landing.

333
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,506
I'm fussy about who I meet.

334
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,132
They're all creeps anyway.

335
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:07,924
Come in. Here.

336
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,353
Come in.

337
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,970
They call me the Glass Man,

338
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,607
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

339
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:22,031
- Amélie Poulain. I'm a waitress at...
- The Two Windmills. I know.

340
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:28,200
And you've come back empty-handed
from your search for Bretodeau.

341
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,958
Because it's not "do", it's "to".

342
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,541
- Like "Toto".
- Thank you.

343
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,050
I love that painting.

344
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,799
It's the Luncheon Of The Boating Party.

345
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,546
By Renoir.

346
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:56,347
I've painted one each year for twenty years.

347
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,691
The hardest part is the looks.

348
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:06,824
I sometimes feel they deliberately change
their mood as soon as my back's turned.

349
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,529
They look quite happy there.

350
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,868
They should be.

351
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,991
This year they had hare with morels.

352
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,829
And waffles with jam for the children.

353
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:23,385
Now, what have I done
with that piece of paper?

354
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:30,887
Ah, you've noticed my video camera
at the window.

355
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,604
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

356
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,517
I put it there

357
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,484
so I don't need to wind up my clocks.

358
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,525
After all these years,

359
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:47,902
the only person I still can't capture

360
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,241
is the girl with the glass of water.

361
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,782
She's in the middle,

362
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,666
yet she's on the outside.

363
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,867
Maybe she's just different from the others.

364
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,716
In what way?

365
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,796
I don't know.

366
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:10,087
When she was little, she can't
have played much with other children.

367
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,182
Maybe never.

368
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,274
Here.

369
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:23,267
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.

370
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,853
It's for you.

371
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:32,070
Every Tuesday morning,
Dominique Bretodeau goes to buy a chicken.

372
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:35,241
He usually roasts it
and has it with sauté potatoes.

373
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,577
After carving the legs,
the breast and the wings,

374
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:42,672
he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers,

375
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,375
starting with the oysters.

376
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,386
But not today. Bretodeau won't buy a chicken.

377
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,892
He'll go no further

378
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,594
than this phone booth here.

379
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,298
In a flash, it all came back to him.

380
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,546
Federico Bahamontes
winning the Tour de France in '59.

381
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,634
Aunt Josette's slips.

382
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:22,272
And most of all, that tragic day.

383
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,268
That tragic day
when he won all the marbles at break time.

384
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,153
Bretodeau!

385
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:41,496
Bretodeau!

386
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,256
The pinch, Bretodeau!

387
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,379
Do you understand, Bretodeau?

388
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,480
Cognac, please.

389
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:10,566
It's amazing, what just happened to me.

390
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:14,825
It must be my guardian angel.
It's the only explanation.

391
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,323
It was as if the phone booth was calling me.

392
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,778
It rang and rang.

393
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:25,377
Same here. The microwave's calling me.

394
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,707
I'll have another cognac.

395
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,850
Life's strange.

396
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,767
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're 50.

397
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,020
All that's left of your childhood

398
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,313
fits in a little box,

399
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,824
a little rusty box.

400
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,782
Have you got kids, miss?

401
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,541
I have a daughter.
She must be about your age.

402
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,293
We haven't spoken for years.

403
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,299
I heard she had a child, a boy.

404
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,505
His name is Lucas.

405
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:31,650
I think it's time I looked them up
before I'm in a box myself.

406
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,405
Don't you think?

407
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:46,374
Amélie suddenly has a strange feeling
of complete harmony.

408
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:52,373
It's a perfect moment. Soft light,
a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the city,

409
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,920
She breathes deeply.
Life seems so simple and clear.

410
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,763
A surge of love,
an urge to help mankind suddenly engulfs her.

411
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:16,776
Let me help you. Step down.

412
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:19,860
Off we go!
We just passed the drum major's widow!

413
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,911
She's worn his coat since the day he died.
Careful.

414
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:26,074
The horse's head on the butcher's
has lost an ear.

415
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,659
That's the florist laughing. He has crinkly eyes.

416
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,795
In the bakery window there are lollipops!

417
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,630
Mmm. Smell that.

418
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,917
They're giving out melon slices.

419
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:41,051
Sugarplum ice cream!

420
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:43,767
We're passing the pork butcher.

421
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,216
Ham, 79 francs. Spareribs, 45!

422
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:51,097
Now the cheese shop.
Picodons are 12.90, cabecous 23.50.

423
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:55,728
At the butcher's a baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens roasting.

424
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:59,196
Now we're at the newspaper kiosk
by the métro.

425
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,317
I'll leave you here. Bye.

426
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:55,083
"She can't relate to other people."

427
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,169
"She was always a lonely child."

428
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:06,092
On a sparkling evening in July,

429
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,012
while on the beaches holidaymakers

430
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,634
relax in the new-found sun,

431
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:14,227
and in Paris the sweltering crowds

432
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:16,647
gaze at the first bursts

433
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,363
of the traditional fireworks,
Amélie Poulain,

434
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,153
godmother of outcasts,

435
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,691
Madonna of the unloved,

436
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,902
finally succumbs to exhaustion.

437
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:32,700
In Paris' grief-stricken streets,

438
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,586
a vast throng of mourners

439
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,749
line her funeral route in silence

440
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:43,259
with the measureless sorrow
of newly orphaned children.

441
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,427
What a strange destiny for one

442
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:47,884
who gave her all,

443
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:53,604
yet took such joy in life's simple pleasures.

444
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:57,266
Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself

445
00:37:57,318 --> 00:38:00,484
against the grinding windmill
of all life's miseries.

446
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,993
It was a losing battle

447
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:17,036
that claimed her life too soon.

448
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,376
At barely 23, Amélie Poulain

449
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:23,041
let her young, tired body merge

450
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:26,509
with the ebb and flow of universal woe.

451
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:32,807
As she went, she felt a stab of regret
for letting her father die

452
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,436
without trying to give his stifled life

453
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:40,729
the breath of air she had given

454
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,854
to so many others.

455
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,156
Wait!

456
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:07,005
Wait!

457
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:10,916
Wait...

458
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,336
Wait, wait!

459
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:05,315
Pages full of dud ID photos
torn up and discarded by their owners,

460
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,023
carefully reassembled by some oddball.

461
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,146
Some family album!

462
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:17,909
A pack of Gauloises.

463
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:22,034
Just a second. It's so smoky in here.
Can you tell me where they are?

464
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,752
- I can't see a thing.
- More to the left.

465
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,454
- There?
- A bit more. There.

466
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:31,623
Thank you. You need change.

467
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:34,083
Forget it.

468
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:36,129
- Yes?
- A mauresque.

469
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,671
A mauresque for the young man.

470
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:42,140
One kir aligoté, one mauresque,
and two mint sodas.

471
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:45,472
Was that prenuptial or post-coital smooching?

472
00:42:45,523 --> 00:42:47,599
Is your bullshit congenital?

473
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,686
- Prenuptial.
- Don't worry.

474
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:53,813
You'll find Mr. Right one day.

475
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:58,234
All women want to sleep on a man's shoulder.
All of them.

476
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:03,113
All men snore after a few drinks,
and I have a musical ear.

477
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:06,914
I had an operation on my nasal cavities.

478
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:09,037
I see you're a born romantic.

479
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,591
I see you've never known true love.

480
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:17,500
I did. It shortened my leg.

481
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:23,510
- I thought you fell off a horse.
- I did.

482
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,051
I was in love with a trapeze artist.

483
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,391
I should have known.
They always drop you at the last minute.

484
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:32,147
He dropped me just before my act.

485
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:37,856
It floored me. And the horse.

486
00:43:37,908 --> 00:43:40,945
With me under it.

487
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:45,244
The mauresque?

488
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:48,208
Still, true love does exist.

489
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:52,202
I'm not saying it doesn't.
After 30 years behind this bar,

490
00:43:52,257 --> 00:43:55,921
I'm an expert. I can even give you the recipe.

491
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:01,014
Take two regulars.

492
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:04,342
Let each think the other fancies them.
Leave it to simmer.

493
00:44:04,393 --> 00:44:06,302
It never fails.

494
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:16,436
Excuse me!

495
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:18,232
Excuse me.

496
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:20,074
- I've had enough.
- I'll go.

497
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:25,822
Haven't you hurt enough people?

498
00:44:29,627 --> 00:44:31,287
Gina can defend herself.

499
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:34,587
I don't mean Gina. I mean Georgette.

500
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:38,833
Georgette?

501
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:41,971
Open your eyes! She craves your attention

502
00:44:42,014 --> 00:44:43,806
but you only have eyes for Gina.

503
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,393
Poor girl! The things she does

504
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:51,514
to catch your eye!

505
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:56,144
You really must be blind.

506
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:06,905
I'm off on a date. Bye!

507
00:45:06,956 --> 00:45:09,032
Goodbye.

508
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:13,707
Whoever her new one is,

509
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:17,337
he can't be worse
than that nut with his tape recorder.

510
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,461
Joseph's not so nutty.

511
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:23,256
He's just in pain.

512
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:26,307
Come off it, Amélie.
They split up two months ago.

513
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:29,636
To keep on coming here every day,
he must be a masochist.

514
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:32,723
Don't say you haven't noticed.

515
00:45:34,442 --> 00:45:35,640
Noticed what?

516
00:45:35,693 --> 00:45:38,563
He always sits here, right?

517
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:40,154
Yes.

518
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:41,572
Sit down.

519
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:43,862
Sit down, Georgette.

520
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:49,288
- What can you see?
- My cigarette counter.

521
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,539
And nothing's missing?

522
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:53,616
No.

523
00:45:54,754 --> 00:45:56,212
Make an effort.

524
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,095
I don't get it!

525
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:08,756
I'll leave you to think about it. Good night.

526
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:28,364
Good morning.

527
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:31,912
Letter Arrives 30 Years Late.

528
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:38,625
A mailbag found by climbers
on a glacier on Mont Blanc was part of a cargo

529
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:42,255
lost in a plane crash in the late 1960s.

530
00:46:43,302 --> 00:46:46,801
So sad! A young, pretty princess for once.

531
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:49,255
Would it be less sad if she were old and ugly?

532
00:46:49,308 --> 00:46:51,515
Of course. Look at Mother Teresa.

533
00:46:53,396 --> 00:46:55,934
Is he still chasing Gina?

534
00:46:55,982 --> 00:46:58,224
No, he's after somebody else now.

535
00:46:58,276 --> 00:47:02,653
- Anyone I know?
- Yes.

536
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:05,104
Funny about this glacier.

537
00:47:05,157 --> 00:47:08,028
Somebody at The Two Windmills?

538
00:47:08,077 --> 00:47:10,200
Not you, surely!

539
00:47:10,246 --> 00:47:11,444
No.

540
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:15,453
Not Suzanne.

541
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:17,459
Surely not!

542
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:19,211
Yes.

543
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:26,418
- Look. There he is again.
- How strange.

544
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:29,839
- And here.
- Him again.

545
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,468
"Gare de Lyon."

546
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:34,383
And here.

547
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:36,097
"March 5th, Austerlitz."

548
00:47:36,147 --> 00:47:40,062
Always the same blank expression.

549
00:47:41,152 --> 00:47:42,646
Twelve times.

550
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:45,649
I counted.

551
00:47:45,698 --> 00:47:47,027
It's very odd.

552
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:52,032
Why keep taking your picture all over town
only to throw them away?

553
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,914
Good ones, too.

554
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:57,828
It's like a sort of ritual.

555
00:47:57,878 --> 00:48:00,084
Maybe he's so terrified

556
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,498
of growing old, it's his only consolation.

557
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:06,623
He's dead.

558
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:08,918
Dead?

559
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:11,806
Yes. He's scared of being forgotten.

560
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:16,060
So he uses the photo booths
to remind people what he looks like.

561
00:48:16,103 --> 00:48:20,517
Like faxing his portrait from the afterlife.

562
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:24,564
A dead man who's scared of being forgotten.

563
00:48:24,612 --> 00:48:27,815
At least these guys here have made it.

564
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:29,988
They're long dead,

565
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:33,948
but they'll never be forgotten.

566
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,746
- The girl with the glass...
- Yes.

567
00:48:38,793 --> 00:48:42,161
Maybe she's distracted
because she's thinking about someone.

568
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:44,123
Somebody in the picture?

569
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:46,790
No.

570
00:48:46,843 --> 00:48:49,548
More likely a boy she saw somewhere,

571
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:53,011
and felt an affinity with.

572
00:48:53,057 --> 00:48:59,226
You mean, she'd rather imagine herself
relating to someone who's absent

573
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:03,980
than build relationships with those around her?

574
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:07,566
No.

575
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:11,777
Maybe she tries hard
to fix other people's messy lives.

576
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:13,783
What about her?

577
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:16,782
And her own messy life?

578
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:20,367
Who'll fix that?

579
00:49:22,044 --> 00:49:25,579
It's better to help people than a garden gnome.

580
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:42,572
The driver had 2.8g of alcohol in his blood!

581
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:44,084
Makes me sick!

582
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:47,081

No radar will ever catch him
while he's working, will it?

587
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:01,174
You shouldn't do that, Mr. Collignon.

588
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:03,137
It's not his fault.

589
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:04,931
True, Mrs. Cauchoix!

590
00:51:04,981 --> 00:51:08,979
It's not his fault he can't sleep. It's Lady Di's.

591
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:15,114
Guess what I found in the truck.
A lingerie catalogue.

592
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:19,619
He'd pasted Lady Di's face over the model's.

593

Yes, but my sciatica kept me awake all night.

- Really?

withers like a flower without sun.

602

Strange weather today.

603
00:52:15,635 --> 00:52:17,295
What's so funny?

604
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:20,678
Everyone who's come in today

- My thirtieth.

Isn't your cousin a book critic?

610

Is your book a love story?

613
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:47,533
No, it's about a guy who keeps a journal.

614
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,909
Not about what's happened to him,

615
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:52,749
but disasters that might happen in the future.

616
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:58,136

- So basically, it's about a loafer.

00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:02,974

Pretty much.

I had two heart attacks
and had to have an abortion

637
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:14,202

01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:10,446
Collignon...

710
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:14,627
- Collignon, big moron, down the john!
- That's it!

711
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:24,627
OK! That's enough for today.

712
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,673
Enough! Enough!

713
01:03:26,724 --> 01:03:29,678
Lucien, stop!

714
01:03:29,727 --> 01:03:31,470
Very good.

715
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:36,514
Mr. Dufayel, I found this under your mat.

716
01:04:53,561 --> 01:04:55,600
Still no win!

717
01:04:55,646 --> 01:04:57,722
Me neither.

718
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:01,807
May I?

719
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:05,229
There's a little...

720
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:12,323
You're gorgeous

721
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:14,079
when you blush.

722
01:05:15,124 --> 01:05:17,496
Like a wild flower.

723
01:05:17,543 --> 01:05:20,876
It's my dyspepsia.

724
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:23,579
Morning, all.

725
01:05:25,134 --> 01:05:26,332
Beautiful day.

726
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:47,147
Pack of Gitanes, please.

727
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:51,112
Bravo! Vive la France! You scalded me.

728
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:55,573
Bravo! Ten out of ten! Bull's-eye!

729
01:05:59,585 --> 01:06:01,744
It was Amélie. She...

730
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:39,743
Do you know what happened
when they went up Mont Blanc?

731
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,248
The silicon in her face froze up.

732
01:06:42,295 --> 01:06:46,791
Her face was a festering mass!

733
01:07:12,658 --> 01:07:16,442
Mulled wine and ginger biscuits.

734
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:19,156
Thank you.

735
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:22,409
I was too hard the other day
on the girl with the glass.

736
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,411
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?

737
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:29,998
No.

738
01:07:31,219 --> 01:07:32,878
They're into different things.

739
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:36,503
Luck is like the Tour de France.

740
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:38,633
You wait, and it flashes past you.

741
01:07:40,227 --> 01:07:44,177
You have to catch it while you can.

742
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:10,333
Can I help you?

743
01:08:10,383 --> 01:08:13,550
Excuse me.
I found this album in the street and I...

744
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:18,173
Nino will be so pleased!
He was so sad the other day.

745
01:08:18,224 --> 01:08:20,181
I almost prayed to St Anthony.

746
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:23,933
Is... Nino there?

747
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:26,766
No. On Wednesdays he works at the funfair.

748
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:31,185
How long has he had this collection?

749
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:35,698
Since I got him the job here, last year.

750
01:08:35,742 --> 01:08:39,953
Before, he collected footprints.
He worked nights.

751
01:08:39,996 --> 01:08:45,950
In the daytime
he took pictures of footprints in wet cement.

752
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:48,160
He's a funny guy.

753
01:08:48,212 --> 01:08:50,501
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.

754
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:55,420
Other things like...

755
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:59,337
Whenever he heard a funny laugh, he'd tape it.

756
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:04,550
Really?

757
01:09:06,397 --> 01:09:09,018
Must be hard for his girlfriend.

758
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:11,391
He never keeps them long.

759
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:14,230
Times are hard for dreamers.

760
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:17,068
Eva! Where are those coffees?

761
01:09:17,117 --> 01:09:19,572
I'd better go. Thanks for the album.

762
01:09:19,619 --> 01:09:23,284
It's OK. I've got time to take it to the funfair.

763
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:27,791
Suit yourself. The ghost train.
Ask for Nino Quincampoix, like the street.

764
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:54,190
I'm looking for Nino. Is he here?

765
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:56,312
He doesn't get off till seven.

766
01:09:57,865 --> 01:10:00,272
- Is there no way to see him before?
- Sure.

767
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:03,197
20 francs.

768
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:15,775
See you next Wednesday.

769
01:11:27,455 --> 01:11:31,916
5pm tomorrow, Montmartre carousel
near the phone box. Bring a 5 franc piece.

770
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:52,142
Want to know about her?

771
01:11:54,733 --> 01:11:57,603
- You know her? You saw her?
- You bet.

772
01:11:57,652 --> 01:11:59,645
She put us in her shirt pocket.

773
01:12:00,697 --> 01:12:02,274
Next to her breast.

774
01:12:02,323 --> 01:12:04,232
Is she pretty?

775
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:06,241
Not bad.

776
01:12:07,286 --> 01:12:09,326
- Beautiful.
- No, pretty.

777
01:12:09,372 --> 01:12:10,700
- Beautiful.
- Pretty.

778
01:12:10,748 --> 01:12:14,580
- What does she want from you?
- She's broke.

779
01:12:14,627 --> 01:12:17,332
She wants a reward for the album.

780
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,669
Or she collects photos, too.

781
01:12:19,716 --> 01:12:24,010
She wants to trade us
for a one-eyed man with glasses!

782
01:12:28,683 --> 01:12:29,714
No, you dope!

783
01:12:31,269 --> 01:12:33,641
She's in love.

784
01:12:33,688 --> 01:12:36,439
- I don't even know her.
- Yes, you do.

785
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:38,309
Since when?

786
01:12:38,359 --> 01:12:40,103
You've always known her.

787
01:12:40,153 --> 01:12:41,433
In your dreams.

788
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:55,953
Hello?

789
01:12:56,002 --> 01:13:00,082
Yes. You! Man with the plastic bag! It's for you.

790
01:13:01,633 --> 01:13:03,092
- Me?
- Yes.

791
01:13:06,429 --> 01:13:07,460
Thank you.

792
01:13:09,432 --> 01:13:10,463
Hello?

793
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:13,268
Follow the blue arrows, Mr. Quincampoix.

794
01:14:38,563 --> 01:14:43,024
When the finger's pointing to the sky,
only a fool looks at the finger.

795
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:56,588
Hello?

796
01:15:57,642 --> 01:15:59,967
I know the stranger in the pictures.

797
01:16:00,019 --> 01:16:04,100
He's a ghost. He's invisible, Mr. Quincampoix.

798
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:07,518
He only appears when the film is developed.

799
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:10,938
When a girl has her photo taken,

800
01:16:10,989 --> 01:16:16,943
he goes "Oooh!" in her ear,
while he gently caresses her neck.

801
01:16:16,995 --> 01:16:19,568
That's how he got caught, Mr. Quincampoix.

802
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:24,574
Who are you?

803
01:16:24,628 --> 01:16:26,087
Page 51.

804
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:36,257
[DO YOU

805
01:16:36,306 --> 01:16:38,132
WANT

806
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:40,638
TO MEET ME?]

807
01:18:18,659 --> 01:18:21,494
Listen to this. "A boy of six,

808
01:18:21,536 --> 01:18:23,695
while his parents sleep, drives off

809
01:18:23,747 --> 01:18:25,490
in a pedal car.

810
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:29,241
Found on a motorway
near Münster in Germany,

811
01:18:29,294 --> 01:18:32,876
he told the police he wanted to see the stars."

812
01:18:32,922 --> 01:18:36,587
Isn't life beautiful, eh?

813
01:18:36,634 --> 01:18:41,213
Love. The only bug she hadn't caught!

814
01:18:41,265 --> 01:18:44,301
- Nobody's immune.
- At least it gives me a break.

815
01:18:44,351 --> 01:18:46,557
Love's a great beautician.

816
01:18:48,772 --> 01:18:52,223
What's she like? Tall? Small? Blonde? Dark?

817
01:18:54,652 --> 01:18:56,728
Let's say... average height.

818
01:18:57,989 --> 01:19:01,026
Not a dwarf or a giraffe. Normal.

819
01:19:02,411 --> 01:19:04,652
Pretty, for her type.

820
01:19:04,705 --> 01:19:07,030
As for blonde or dark...

821
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:11,709
...it's hard to say, but she wasn't a redhead.

822
01:19:11,753 --> 01:19:13,627
- Unless...
- Forget it.

823
01:19:14,756 --> 01:19:19,631
I do remember she casually asked
if you had a girlfriend.

824
01:19:19,677 --> 01:19:20,708
And?

825
01:19:20,762 --> 01:19:23,218
I said you weren't interested, right?

826
01:19:24,641 --> 01:19:26,136
You didn't!

827
01:19:26,185 --> 01:19:28,426
What do you care? You don't even know her.

828
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:33,691
- Exactly. It's the mystery.
- You won't find mystery here.

829
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:35,940
A pound of nectarines, please.

830
01:19:35,986 --> 01:19:38,821
These ones here are the prettiest.

831
01:19:38,863 --> 01:19:40,986
Trust him. He's an artist!

832
01:19:41,032 --> 01:19:44,116
He's been going home every night
with tons of unsold stock.

833
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:47,328
What for? Is he stewing a pig?

834
01:19:47,372 --> 01:19:49,531
No, sir! He's studying art!

835
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:53,283
He sells leeks all day long
and paints turnips all night!

836
01:19:53,336 --> 01:19:55,412
The boy's a useless vegetable.

837
01:19:55,464 --> 01:19:56,958
A good prompter

838
01:19:57,007 --> 01:20:00,589
in each cellar window
whispering cutting retorts

839
01:20:00,635 --> 01:20:03,256
would mean shy people had the last laugh.

840
01:20:03,304 --> 01:20:05,760
At least you'll never be a vegetable.

841
01:20:05,807 --> 01:20:08,049
Even artichokes

842
01:20:08,102 --> 01:20:09,133
have hearts.

843
01:20:12,147 --> 01:20:15,765
You'll never be a vegetable.
Even artichokes have hearts!

844
01:20:57,192 --> 01:20:58,817
Memory seven.

845
01:21:16,503 --> 01:21:20,750
Darling Mado,
I miss you more and more each day.

846
01:21:20,799 --> 01:21:24,085
I'm an exile in a world of dreary khaki.

847
01:21:24,136 --> 01:21:26,424
I can't sleep, can't eat...

848
01:21:26,471 --> 01:21:29,176
This camp was the biggest mistake of my life,

849
01:21:29,224 --> 01:21:33,008
depriving me of my beloved
for five long weeks.

850
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:35,931
I think of you endlessly. Your Adrien.

851
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:42,483
I turned down my last month's wages
instead of giving notice.

852
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:46,864
I dream of better times ahead.

853
01:21:46,908 --> 01:21:50,906
An orange-coloured day. Remember, my love?

854
01:21:50,954 --> 01:21:53,030
Your ever-loving Adrien.

855
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:56,243
Good news, darling Mado.

856
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:59,626
Soon I'll be able to afford a car

857
01:21:59,671 --> 01:22:02,163
and drive home every night.

858
01:22:02,216 --> 01:22:06,628
Till then, meet me on Friday and we'll go out.

859
01:24:53,595 --> 01:24:55,801
[MOTHER]

860
01:24:58,642 --> 01:25:00,718
Psychiatric Helpline.

861
01:25:02,271 --> 01:25:04,347
Hello? Hello?

862
01:25:33,093 --> 01:25:35,549
[WHERE & WHEN?]

863
01:25:45,272 --> 01:25:47,728
One hour later at 11 Boulevard St Martin,

864
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:51,393
Amélie walks into a party goods
and costume shop.

865
01:25:52,446 --> 01:25:56,907
At the same time,
a man leaves his home at 108 Rue Lecourbe.

866
01:25:58,869 --> 01:26:02,617
26 minutes later, Amélie is at the photo booth
at the Gare de I'Est.

867
01:26:06,876 --> 01:26:10,957
Simultaneously,
the man in red shoes parks outside.

868
01:26:11,006 --> 01:26:14,375
The time is exactly 11:40.

869
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:02,090
At this precise moment,

870
01:27:02,141 --> 01:27:06,886
only Amélie has the key
to the riddle of the mystery man.

871
01:27:11,775 --> 01:27:13,483
How's it going, Mrs. Wells?

872
01:27:13,527 --> 01:27:16,363
It's always better when it's not raining.

873
01:27:16,405 --> 01:27:18,861
- This is for you.
- Me?

874
01:27:28,792 --> 01:27:32,493
Dear Mrs. Wells,
We recently recovered a mailbag

875
01:27:32,546 --> 01:27:34,622
that was lost in a plane crash

876
01:27:34,673 --> 01:27:38,339
on October 12th 1969 on Mont Blanc.

877
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:42,846
We are forwarding the enclosed letter
to your address.

878
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:47,053
Please accept our apologies
for the uncustomary delay.

Jacques Grosjean, Customer Services.

880
01:27:51,148 --> 01:27:55,442
Darling Mado, I'm in exile.
I can't sleep, can't eat.

881
01:27:55,485 --> 01:27:57,229
I think of you endlessly.

882
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:01,147
I know I've made
the biggest mistake of my life.

883
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,905
I turned down that woman's money.

884
01:28:03,953 --> 01:28:08,911
If all goes well,
I'll soon be able to afford a house.

885
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:11,994
I dream of better times ahead

886
01:28:12,044 --> 01:28:15,911
when you'll forgive me and join me here

887
01:28:15,964 --> 01:28:19,333
one orange-coloured day.
Your ever-loving Adrien.

888
01:28:49,165 --> 01:28:51,323
Mr. Dufayel, another package for you.

889
01:29:01,134 --> 01:29:04,384
Mr. Dufayel, do you know
what happened to the concierge?

890
01:29:05,806 --> 01:29:07,135
She got a letter.

891
01:29:08,184 --> 01:29:11,019
From her husband. 40 years late.

892
01:29:13,356 --> 01:29:15,431
That's a lot, isn't it, Mr. Dufayel?

893
01:29:28,662 --> 01:29:32,114
I'm not big on still life, Mr. Dufayel.

894
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:35,167
Then work on your thin layer.

895
01:29:35,211 --> 01:29:37,962
Fat over thin. Always!

896
01:29:56,816 --> 01:29:58,607
- Mr. Dufayel...
- Yes!

897
01:29:58,651 --> 01:30:03,028
The papers said
that there'll soon be a new star.

898
01:30:03,072 --> 01:30:10,201
- So you're into stars now?
- I saw it on TV at my mum's, that's why.

899
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:13,782
I don't know if it's true.

900
01:30:13,832 --> 01:30:16,158
In America

901
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:19,496
they're going to take all the rich people's ashes,

902
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:22,216
put them in a satellite

903
01:30:22,258 --> 01:30:24,583
and shoot it into space.

904
01:30:24,635 --> 01:30:27,007
The satellite's going to shine for ever.

905
01:30:31,642 --> 01:30:33,184
And Lady Di...

906
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:35,468
Will they do the same for her?

907
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,552
Lady Di, Lady Di!

908
01:30:36,606 --> 01:30:37,851
Give it a rest!

909
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,650
I can't concentrate.

910
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:43,851
Lady Di!

911
01:30:44,947 --> 01:30:45,978
Lady Di!

912
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:48,230
Renoir.

913
01:32:29,552 --> 01:32:30,583
Morning, sir.

914
01:32:47,319 --> 01:32:48,350
Cambodia.

915
01:32:53,952 --> 01:32:55,695
I don't understand.

916
01:32:55,745 --> 01:32:59,612
Brilliant! You couldn't have done better.

917
01:32:59,665 --> 01:33:02,868
- Did it work?
- It's getting there.

918
01:33:02,918 --> 01:33:05,836
Ask me again any time. The harm's done.

919
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,545
- What do you mean?
- Everybody calls me Snow White!

920
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:18,117
[The Two Windmills café from 4pm.]

921
01:34:24,626 --> 01:34:26,535
- Eva?
- Yes?

922
01:34:26,586 --> 01:34:30,334
Could you stand in for me at four?

923
01:34:30,381 --> 01:34:32,290
Again?

924
01:34:35,636 --> 01:34:37,095
Close the door!

925
01:34:39,265 --> 01:34:41,257
What's up with him?

926
01:34:41,308 --> 01:34:43,052
Is he sulking?

927
01:34:43,102 --> 01:34:46,685
- He thinks I smile too much.
- He'd rather you frowned?

928
01:34:46,731 --> 01:34:49,648
With other men, yes.

929
01:34:52,361 --> 01:34:56,774
Nino is late. Amélie can only think
of two possible explanations.

930
01:34:56,824 --> 01:34:58,900
Firstly, that he didn't find the photo.

931
01:35:00,744 --> 01:35:03,200
Secondly, before he could assemble it,

932
01:35:03,247 --> 01:35:07,542
a gang of bank robbers took him hostage.

933
01:35:07,585 --> 01:35:09,578
The cops gave chase.

934
01:35:09,629 --> 01:35:11,420
They got away,

935
01:35:11,464 --> 01:35:14,216
but he caused a crash.

936
01:35:14,258 --> 01:35:16,465
When he came to,

937
01:35:16,511 --> 01:35:18,170
he'd lost his memory,

938
01:35:20,056 --> 01:35:21,929
An ex-con picked him up,

939
01:35:21,974 --> 01:35:26,185
mistook him for a fugitive,
and shipped him to Istanbul.

940
01:35:27,146 --> 01:35:29,388
He met some Afghan raiders,

941
01:35:29,441 --> 01:35:33,023
who took him to steal
some Russian warheads.

942
01:35:36,656 --> 01:35:40,488
But their truck hit a mine
at the border with Tajikistan.

943
01:35:40,535 --> 01:35:46,039
He survived, took to the hills,
and became a Mujaheddin.

944
01:35:46,082 --> 01:35:49,035
Amélie refuses to get upset for a guy

945
01:35:49,084 --> 01:35:53,664
who'll eat borscht all his life
in a hat like a tea cosy.

946
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:15,107
- What can I get you?
- A coffee, please.

947
01:36:16,196 --> 01:36:18,069
A coffee.

948
01:36:40,095 --> 01:36:41,553
Here's your coffee.

949
01:36:43,097 --> 01:36:44,129
Thank you.

950
01:37:07,830 --> 01:37:10,156
[Today's menu]

951
01:37:19,175 --> 01:37:20,633
He's understood.

952
01:37:20,676 --> 01:37:23,880
He's going to put his teaspoon down,

953
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:28,889
dip his finger in the sugar,

954
01:37:33,648 --> 01:37:36,352
turn around slowly,

955
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,476
and speak to me.

956
01:37:44,075 --> 01:37:46,068
Excuse me.

957
01:37:47,579 --> 01:37:48,824
Is this you?

958
01:37:55,294 --> 01:37:56,539
Yes, it's you.

959
01:38:17,233 --> 01:38:19,309
I'll take that.

960
01:38:21,737 --> 01:38:23,397
Another coffee?

961
01:38:23,447 --> 01:38:25,570
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
- OK.

962
01:38:46,137 --> 01:38:50,598
So it's this man here,
the one with his hand up?

963
01:38:51,852 --> 01:38:52,883
Yes.

964
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:58,100
Is she in love with him?

965
01:39:00,902 --> 01:39:01,933
Yes.

966
01:39:03,863 --> 01:39:07,232
I think it's time she took a real risk.

967
01:39:07,283 --> 01:39:11,779
She might just do that.
She's devising a stratagem.

968
01:39:11,829 --> 01:39:15,495
She's fond of stratagems.

969
01:39:17,544 --> 01:39:18,575
Yes.

970
01:39:20,296 --> 01:39:22,419
In fact, she's cowardly.

971
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:27,169
That's why I can't capture her look.

972
01:39:29,013 --> 01:39:34,517
Dufayel's attempts to meddle are intolerable!

973
01:39:37,022 --> 01:39:42,976
If Amélie chooses to live in a dream

974
01:39:43,028 --> 01:39:47,239
and remain an introverted young woman,

975
01:39:47,282 --> 01:39:51,943
she has an absolute right to mess up her life!

976
01:40:26,696 --> 01:40:28,440
What are you doing, Mr. Dufayel?

977
01:40:30,825 --> 01:40:32,948
Tell me, Lucien.

978
01:40:32,994 --> 01:40:37,869
For deliveries,
do you keep keys to all the apartments?

979
01:40:50,345 --> 01:40:54,212
One of your booths is out of order.

980
01:40:56,351 --> 01:40:58,889
It seems to be jammed.

981
01:41:00,021 --> 01:41:02,309
Gare de I'Est ticket hall.

982
01:41:05,151 --> 01:41:07,524
- Buy a video, get one free.
- No, thanks.

983
01:41:14,285 --> 01:41:15,945
Sam?

984
01:41:16,996 --> 01:41:18,028
Samantha?

985
01:41:21,376 --> 01:41:22,407
Samantha?

986
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:29,250
Can you stand in for me at...

987
01:41:51,698 --> 01:41:55,363
Photo booth, Gare de I'Est ticket hall,
Tuesday 5pm.

988
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:58,744
[Can you stand in for me this afternoon?]

989
01:43:09,985 --> 01:43:11,313
Almost done.

990
01:43:16,449 --> 01:43:20,495
The mystery man wasn't a ghost
or a man scared of ageing,

991
01:43:20,537 --> 01:43:22,613
but simply the repairman,

992
01:43:22,664 --> 01:43:25,120
a normal guy doing his job.

993
01:43:27,252 --> 01:43:28,912
Sorry.

994
01:44:14,549 --> 01:44:17,918
He keeps spying on me!
It's making me sick.

995
01:44:17,969 --> 01:44:21,385
4:05: Blatant female conspiracy.

996
01:44:22,432 --> 01:44:25,883
Gosh, you're tense, Georgette!

997
01:44:26,936 --> 01:44:28,479
Good luck. You'll need it.

998
01:44:33,902 --> 01:44:38,480
Excuse me. Did you put this in my pocket?

999
01:44:38,532 --> 01:44:41,947
- Yes, but I'm not the one...
- I know. Where is she?

1000
01:44:41,993 --> 01:44:43,535
She's at her father's.

1001
01:44:43,578 --> 01:44:48,999
It's awkward. I'd like to speak to you, but...
I finish work at six.

1002
01:44:49,042 --> 01:44:51,000
- Can you come back?
- OK.

1003
01:44:52,045 --> 01:44:53,125
See you later.

1004
01:44:53,172 --> 01:44:56,754
4:08: Docking scheduled.

1005
01:45:28,581 --> 01:45:33,243
The blond guy in a camel coat.
He's very absent-minded, too.

1006
01:45:33,294 --> 01:45:35,039
How come?

1007
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:38,545
He came back three times the same afternoon.

1008
01:45:39,801 --> 01:45:41,082
1:12:

1009
01:45:41,136 --> 01:45:42,416
Camel coat.

1010
01:45:42,471 --> 01:45:43,716
2:50:

1011
01:45:43,764 --> 01:45:45,590
Camel coat.

1012
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:47,847
- 4:17: Camel coat.
- Stop it!

1013
01:45:48,894 --> 01:45:52,097
My rash has come back! Look, Suzanne!

1014
01:45:52,147 --> 01:45:55,847
My rash is back. He's driving me nuts.

1015
01:45:55,900 --> 01:45:58,060
Lay off!

1016
01:45:58,112 --> 01:46:02,405
If she had a clear conscience,
she wouldn't be in such a state.

1017
01:46:02,449 --> 01:46:04,406
I've had it. I'm going home.

1018
01:46:04,451 --> 01:46:07,950
Psychos are the last straw!

1019
01:46:09,331 --> 01:46:11,370
Georgette! Georg...

1020
01:46:12,959 --> 01:46:15,711
Stop smothering them!
Women need to breathe.

1021
01:46:15,754 --> 01:46:19,039
You let them breathe,
they want a change of air.

1022
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:20,965
Fresh air's healthy.

1023
01:46:21,010 --> 01:46:23,002
Shut it, failure!

1024
01:46:25,556 --> 01:46:27,263
Failed writer, failed life...

1025
01:46:27,307 --> 01:46:29,881
I love the word "fail".

1026
01:46:29,935 --> 01:46:31,974
Failure is human destiny.

1027
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:33,598
It's gasbag time!

1028
01:46:33,647 --> 01:46:36,897
Failure teaches us that life is but a draft,

1029
01:46:36,941 --> 01:46:40,809
a long rehearsal for a show that will never play.

1030
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:44,564
I bet he stole that.

1031
01:46:44,617 --> 01:46:47,107
I do have some original ideas,

1032
01:46:47,161 --> 01:46:52,617
but people always steal them.
A bit like your women.

1033
01:46:52,666 --> 01:46:54,705
Meaning?

1034
01:46:54,751 --> 01:46:57,954
Meaning you'd better get used to it.

1035
01:46:58,004 --> 01:47:00,542
Speak for yourself, you...

1036
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:01,621
What?

1037
01:47:05,387 --> 01:47:08,507
- What's going on?
- Nothing much. Georgette went out.

1038
01:47:08,557 --> 01:47:10,300
Joseph got mad.

1039
01:47:10,350 --> 01:47:11,845
"Went out?"

1040
01:47:11,894 --> 01:47:17,101
Just like Gina. You know who's she's with?
The guy with the plastic bag.

1041
01:47:18,817 --> 01:47:21,189
I saw their little game.

1042
01:47:21,236 --> 01:47:23,561
The note in the coat pocket,

1043
01:47:23,613 --> 01:47:25,238
4:08.

1044
01:47:25,281 --> 01:47:29,232
Back he comes, and hey presto!
Out they go.

1045
01:47:33,165 --> 01:47:36,830
- I'm worried for Amélie because I like you.
- What do you mean?

1046
01:47:37,878 --> 01:47:41,662
By and large, the men I like
are mentally unsound.

1047
01:47:41,715 --> 01:47:44,751
- I'd like to know more about you.
- Ask me questions.

1048
01:47:47,554 --> 01:47:49,346
One swallow doesn't make...?

1049
01:47:50,432 --> 01:47:51,464
A swallow?

1050
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:54,602
A summer.

1051
01:47:54,645 --> 01:47:56,020
And clothes...?

1052
01:47:56,063 --> 01:47:57,605
The man.

1053
01:47:57,648 --> 01:47:59,058
- A good cat deserves...?
- A rat.

1054
01:47:59,107 --> 01:48:00,767
- Patience...?
- Is a virtue.

1055
01:48:00,817 --> 01:48:02,395
- Rolling stone...?
- Gathers no moss.

1056
01:48:02,444 --> 01:48:04,769
- It's a sin...?
- To steal a pin.

1057
01:48:04,821 --> 01:48:06,814
Absence makes...?

1058
01:48:06,865 --> 01:48:08,324
The heart grow fonder.

1059
01:48:08,366 --> 01:48:10,359
- Not bad.
- You collect them?

1060
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:14,740
In my family, we say a man
who knows his proverbs can't be all bad.

1061
01:48:19,336 --> 01:48:22,787
Pretty girl from the 5th floor, listen to this!

1062
01:48:22,839 --> 01:48:25,793
- Do you believe in miracles?
- Not today.

1063
01:48:27,219 --> 01:48:29,377
You're in for a surprise.

1064
01:48:29,429 --> 01:48:32,762
What if I told you that a team of climbers

1065
01:48:32,807 --> 01:48:36,758
on Mont Blanc had found

1066
01:48:36,812 --> 01:48:41,438
hard proof that my husband loved me?

1067
01:49:14,808 --> 01:49:16,931
Lucien, I need some yeast.

1068
01:49:16,977 --> 01:49:20,892
For Miss Amélie?
She's baking her famous plum cake?

1069
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:23,894
Collignon! Go and get the yeast.

1070
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:19,704
Amélie?

1071
01:50:19,748 --> 01:50:20,779
Amélie?

1072
01:50:28,132 --> 01:50:29,163
Amélie?

1073
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:52,061
[I'll be back]

1074
01:51:23,145 --> 01:51:26,146
Go into the bedroom, Miss Poulain.

1075
01:51:42,206 --> 01:51:45,325
So, little Amélie,

1076
01:51:45,376 --> 01:51:49,455
your bones aren't made of glass.

1077
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:52,624
You can take life's knocks.

1078
01:51:52,674 --> 01:51:57,052
If you let this chance go by,

1079
01:51:57,096 --> 01:52:03,763
eventually your heart will become

1080
01:52:03,811 --> 01:52:09,849
as dry and brittle as my skeleton.

1081
01:52:11,485 --> 01:52:13,027
So...

1082
01:52:13,070 --> 01:52:16,236
Go and get him, for pete's sake!

1083
01:55:03,741 --> 01:55:09,577
[Without you, today's emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday's]

1084
01:56:05,887 --> 01:56:07,595
International airport.

1085
01:56:07,638 --> 01:56:12,680
September 28th 1997. It is exactly 11am.

1086
01:56:12,727 --> 01:56:15,431
At the funfair, near the ghost train,

1087
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:18,646
the marshmallow twister is twisting.

1088
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:20,979
Meanwhile, on a bench in Villette Square,

1089
01:56:21,026 --> 01:56:26,483
Félix Lerbier learns there are more links
in his brain than atoms in the universe.

1090
01:56:27,575 --> 01:56:28,690
Meanwhile,

1091
01:56:28,743 --> 01:56:32,408
at the Sacré Cœur,
the nuns are practising their backhand.

1092
01:56:32,455 --> 01:56:34,862
The temperature is 24°C,

1093
01:56:34,916 --> 01:56:36,789
humidity 70%,

1094
01:56:36,834 --> 01:56:40,084
atmospheric pressure 999 millibars.
