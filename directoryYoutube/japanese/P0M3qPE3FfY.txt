    Solo talking videos like this seem to be popular with everyone,   [00:15,8]
- "motto, kou iu douga wo tsukutte hoshii" tte iu rikuesuto ga kekkou atta no de,	 [00:20,3]
    and there were quite a few requests for more of these, so   [00:20,3]
- kyou mo, hitori de berabera shaberu douga wo tsukuritai to omoimasu.	 [00:24,8]
    today, I want to make a video of me blabbering alone.   [00:24,8]

    Yes, so today's topic is "Why I chose Japan."   [00:30,8]
- tte iu no mo, ima watashi wa amerika ni iru n desukedo,	 [00:40,0]
    Well, currently, I am in the United States,   [00:40,0]
- 12 gatsumatsu ni nihon ni kaeru yotei desu.	 [00:44,3]
    but I plan to return to Japan at the end of December.   [00:44,3]
- sumimasen. mou sugu kurisumasu na no de,	 [00:47,7]
    Sorry. Since Christmas is coming soon,   [00:47,7]
- metcha kurisumasu no fuku wo kite(i)ru n desukedo,	 [00:50,4]
    I'm wearing a Christmas outfit, but   [00:50,4]
- ta bun, kono douga wo appuroodo suru no wa, 12 gatsumatsu ka 1 tsuki da to omou no de,	 [00:53,2]
    I think I'll upload this video at the end of December or January,   [00:53,2]
- sugoku kisetsuhazure na fuku na n desukedo, sumimasen.	 [00:58,7]
    so it's a very out-of-season outfit, sorry.   [00:58,7]
- eetto, sou, 12 gatsumatsu ni nihon ni kaeru yotei desu.	 [01:03,7]
    Um, so, yes, I plan to return to Japan at the end of December.   [01:03,7]
- ima made, nihon ni mo kaigai ni mo sunda koto ga atte,	 [01:08,4]
    I've lived in both Japan and abroad before,   [01:08,4]
- dotchi ni sumu ka, kekkou nayande(i)ta n desu yo, nihon ka kaigai ka.	 [01:12,3]
    and I was quite undecided about whether to live in Japan or abroad.   [01:12,3]
- motomoto watashi wa, nihon ni sumitaku nakattakara,	 [01:16,8]
    Originally, I didn't want to live in Japan,   [01:16,8]
- gaikoku go wo benkyou shita n desu yo.	 [01:20,2]
    so I studied foreign languages.   [01:20,2]
- supein go to eigo wo benkyou shita n desu yo.	 [01:22,3]
    I studied Spanish and English.   [01:22,3]
- de mo, kekkyoku, yappari nihon ga ii na tte omotta no de,	 [01:24,7]
    But in the end, I thought Japan was the best,   [01:24,7]
- kyou wa, sono riyuu ni tsuite hanashitai to omoimasu.	 [01:31,1]
    so today, I want to talk about the reasons for that.   [01:31,1]
- hai, risuto wo tsukutte kita n desukedo,	 [01:34,1]
    Yes, I've made a list,   [01:34,1]
- 10ko, omoni riyuu ga arimasu.	 [01:38,5]
    and there are 10 main reasons.   [01:38,5]
- jaa, hitotsume kara itte ikimasu ne.	 [01:42,4]
    So, let's start with the first one.   [01:42,4]
- hitotsume. hitotsume wa, nihon wa sugoku chiisai kuni dakedo,	 [01:45,3]
    The first one. The first one is that Japan is a very small country,   [01:45,3]
- honto ni ironna omoshiroi tokoro ga atte,	 [01:50,4]
    but it has really interesting places,   [01:50,4]
- sorezore no chiiki ni tokuchou ga aru no de, omoshiroi desu.	 [01:53,8]
    and each region has its own characteristics, so it's interesting.   [01:53,8]
- minasan wa "nihon" tte kikuto, nan wo omoiukabemasu ka.	 [01:59,3]
    When you hear "Japan," what comes to mind?   [01:59,3]
- maa, nihon ni kita koto ga nai hito wa, kitto tokyo to ka, osaka to ka, sou iu ookii machi wo omoiukaberu to omou n desu yo.	 [02:05,4]
    Well, for those who haven't been to Japan, they probably think of Tokyo, Osaka, and such big cities.   [02:05,4]
- maa, tekunorojii to ka, sou desu ne. tokyo tawaa to ka,	 [02:16,4]
    Well, technology and Tokyo Tower,   [02:16,4]
- sou iu koto wo omoiukaberu to omou n desukedo,	 [02:22,3]
    they might think of things like that,   [02:22,3]
- honto ni nihon ni wa, ironna omoshiroi tokoro ga arimasu.	 [02:25,5]
    but there are really interesting places in Japan.   [02:25,5]
- de, sakki mo itta you ni, chiiki ni yotte tokuchou ga atte,	 [02:31,1]
    As I mentioned earlier, each region has its own characteristics,   [02:31,1]
- tatoeba kirei na umi de oyogitakattara,	 [02:34,6]
- okinawa ni ikeba iishi,	 [02:38,9]
    for example, if you want to swim in a beautiful sea, you can go to Okinawa,   [02:34,6]
- fuyu no supootsu to ka, yuki wo tanoshimitakattara,	 [02:41,0]
    or if you want to enjoy winter sports and snow,   [02:41,0]
- fuyu ni nagano ken to ka, hokkaidou ni ikeba iishi,	 [02:44,1]
    you can go to Nagano or Hokkaido in winter,   [02:44,1]
- haikingu wo shitakattara,	 [02:47,7]
    if you want to go hiking,   [02:47,7]
- nagano ken to ka, sou desu ne. fuji yama to ka,	 [02:49,9]
    Nagano or, well... places with many hiking spots like Mt. Fuji,   [02:49,9]
- maa, ironna tokoro ni haikingu supotto ga arimasu.	 [02:55,0]
    well, there are many hiking spots in various places.   [02:55,0]
- de, ato onsen, nihon wa onsen de yuumei desu yo ne.	 [02:59,0]
    And hot springs, Japan is famous for hot springs, right?   [02:59,0]
- onsen ni hairitakattara,	 [03:03,8]
    If you want to enjoy a hot spring,   [03:03,8]
- tatoeba hakone to ka, ooita ken to ka, kusatsu to ka ne,	 [03:05,7]
    for example, Hakone, Oita,Kusatsu, and so on,   [03:05,7]
- takusan onsen ga yuumei na tokoro ga arimasu.	 [03:13,2]
    there are many famous hot spring areas.   [03:13,2]
- ato wa tabemono mo, chiiki ni yotte sorezore meibutsu ga aru no de,	 [03:17,3]
    Also, in terms of food, each region has its own specialty,   [03:17,3]
- ryokou ni ikuto, ironna tabemono wo tanoshimu koto ga dekimasu.	 [03:22,5]
    so when you travel, you can enjoy various foods.   [03:22,5]
- dakara nihon tte, chiisai kuni na n desukedo,	 [03:27,6]
    So, although Japan is a small country,   [03:27,6]
- nan de mo aru to omou n desu yo.	 [03:30,9]
    I think it has everything.   [03:30,9]
- sou desu ne. tokyo dake ja nakute, ironna tokoro ni itte mite hoshii desu.	 [03:32,4]
    Yes, not just Tokyo, but I want you to go to various places.   [03:32,4]
- dakara kaigai ni mo, mochiron, kirei na tokoro takusan arushi,	 [03:41,8]
    So, of course, there are many beautiful places abroad,   [03:41,8]
- honto ni subarashii keshiki no basho mo, takusan aru n desukedo,	 [03:46,2]
    and there are really wonderful scenic places,   [03:46,2]
- nihon ni sunde iru dake de, takusan tanoshimeru na tte kizukimashita.	 [03:50,4]
    but just by living in Japan, I realized that there's a lot to enjoy.   [03:50,4]
- hai tsugi, tsugi futatsume wa, oubei ni kurabete yachin to ie ga yasui.	 [03:55,5]
    Okay next, the next one is that rent and houses are cheaper compared to the West.   [03:55,5]
- kore, honto ni sou da to omoimasu.	 [04:03,3]
    I really think this is true.   [04:03,3]
- ima amerika ni iru n desukedo,	 [04:05,9]
    Right now, I'm in the United States,   [04:05,9]
- amerika tte, yachin takai desu yo ne.	 [04:08,0]
    and rent in the United States is high, you know.   [04:08,0]
- amerika no mae wa, oosutoraria ni ita n desukedo,	 [04:12,7]
    Before the U.S., I was in Australia,   [04:12,7]
- oosutoraria mo metcha takakatta desu.	 [04:15,4]
    and Australia was also very expensive.   [04:15,4]
- de, ironna kaigai no tomodachi ni kikuto,	 [04:17,9]
    And asking various friends from abroad,   [04:17,9]
- "ie no nedan ga, dondon agatte iru" tte itte imashita.	 [04:21,6]
    they said, "The prices of houses are constantly rising."   [04:21,6]
- nihon wa, jinkou ga dondon hette iru no de,	 [04:27,3]
    In Japan, the population is decreasing,   [04:27,3]
- chuuko no bukken,	 [04:33,5]
    so for used properties,   [04:33,5]
- "chuuko" tte iu no wa, atarashii mono ja nakute,	 [04:35,4]
    "Chuuko" meaning not new,   [04:35,4]
- maa, dare ka ga sunda koto ga aru tokoro desu ne.	 [04:39,8]
    well, it's a place where someone has lived.   [04:39,8]
- maa, ie dake ja nakute,	 [04:44,0]
    Well, not just houses,   [04:44,0]
- "chuuko" tte iuto, dare ka ga tsukatta koto ga aru mono mo sou desu ne.	 [04:45,7]
    when we say "Chuuko," it also refers to things that someone has used.   [04:45,7]
- tatoeba "chuuko no hon" to ka "chuuko hon" tte iuto,	 [04:51,8]
    For example, "Chuuko no hon," "Chuukobon"   [04:51,8]
- maa, dare ka ga yonda koto ga aru hon tte iu koto desu ne.	 [04:55,5]
    well, it means books that someone has read.   [04:55,5]
- atarashii hon de wa naitte koto desu.	 [04:58,7]
    It's not a new book.   [04:58,7]
- dakara, chuuko no manshon to ka, ikkenya dato, sonna ni takaku nai to omoimasu.	 [05:01,3]
    So, for used apartments or houses, I think they are not that expensive.   [05:01,3]
- maa, kuni ni yotte wa, nihon yori mo yasui tokoro mo aru to omou n desukedo,	 [05:11,8]
    Well, there may be cheaper places in other countries than Japan,   [05:11,8]
- oubei ni kuraberuto, nihon no yachin mo ie mo yasui to omoimasu.	 [05:18,1]
    but compared to the West, I think rent and houses in Japan are cheap.   [05:18,1]
- tatoeba watashi wa, kyoto de hitorigurashi wo shita koto ga aru n desukedo,	 [05:25,5]
    For example, I lived alone in Kyoto,   [05:25,5]
- sono toki wa, 1LDK...	 [05:29,7]
    at that time, it was a 1LDK...   [05:29,7]
- maa, ribingu to ka kitchin ga aru heya to, ato mou hito heya de,	 [05:32,8]
    well, a room which is a living room and kitchen, and another room,   [05:32,8]
- kekkou machi no chuushin ni, sono apaato wa atta n desukedo,	 [05:38,5]
    the apartment was quite central in the town,   [05:38,5]
- 7 man gosen en deshita ne.	 [05:43,7]
    and it was 75,000 yen.   [05:43,7]
- dakara, ima dato 500 doru gurai ka na.	 [05:45,8]
    So, now it's about 500 dollars.   [05:45,8]
- sou, de mo... maa, amerika wa nihon yori mo apaato no saizu wa ookiikedo,	 [05:50,5]
    Yeah, but... well, in the U.S., apartments are larger than in Japan, but   [05:50,5]
- amerika de 1LDKno apaato wo karitara,	 [05:57,7]
    if you rent a 1LDK apartment in the U.S.,   [05:57,7]
- 1000 doru wo koemasu yo ne.	 [06:02,7]
    it will be over 1000 dollars.   [06:02,7]
- un, 1500 doru to ka,	 [06:05,6]
    Or 1500 dollars,   [06:05,6]
- de, shikamo sore wa, nyuuyooku to ka rosanzerusu to ka, ookii machi no chuushin no apaato ja nakute mo,	 [06:07,5]
    and moreover, even in the countryside, not just in the center of big cities like New York or Los Angeles,   [06:07,5]
- kekkou inaka de mo, 1LDKwa 1000 doru ijou da tte kikimashita.	 [06:15,4]
    I heard that 1LDK is over 1000 dollars.   [06:15,4]
- dakara sumu no wa, kekkou yasui to omoimasu, nihon wa.	 [06:24,8]
    So, I think it's quite cheap to live in Japan.   [06:24,8]
- hai, dakara, sore mo yappari ne, taisetsu na koto desu yo ne.	 [06:31,8]
    Yes, so, that's also important, right?   [06:31,8]
- ikite iku ue de, yachin to ka ie tte taisetsu desukara,	 [06:38,5]
    In living, rent and housing are important,   [06:38,5]
- sore ga yasui no wa, sugoku ii na to omoimashita.	 [06:44,0]
    and it's really nice that they are cheap.   [06:44,0]
- hai, mittsume.	 [06:47,6]
    Yes, the third one.   [06:47,6]
- mittsume wa, sekkyaku, kasutamaa saabisu ga teinei.	 [06:48,9]
    The third one is that customer service is polite.   [06:48,9]
- kore wa, ima made mo nan kai mo itta koto ga aru to omou n desukedo,	 [06:54,6]
    I think I've said this many times before,   [06:54,6]
- honto ni, nihon ni kaette kite itsu mo omou no wa, minna teinei da na tte iu koto desu ne.	 [06:59,0]
    but really, whenever I come back to Japan, what I always think is that everyone is polite.   [06:59,0]
- minna teinei de, yasashii na tte iu koto desu ne.	 [07:07,1]
    Everyone is polite and kind.   [07:07,1]
- kotoshi, indoneshia no bari ni itta n desukedo,	 [07:11,0]
    This year, I went to Bali, Indonesia,   [07:11,0]
- bari no hoteru de, chotto mondai ga atte,	 [07:14,6]
    and there was a problem with the hotel in Bali,   [07:14,6]
- mou, soko ni wa tomarenai joukyou ni natta n desu ne, iroiro mondai ga atte.	 [07:17,7]
    so I couldn't stay there anymore, there were various problems.   [07:17,7]
- de, hoteru no hito ni, sono mondai ni tsuite hanashite,	 [07:24,5]
    So, I talked to the hotel staff about the problem,   [07:24,5]
- "henkin shite kudasai"	 [07:30,2]
    "I want a refund."   [07:30,2]
- "watashitachi, kyou chekku in shitakedo, chekkuauto suru no de, yoyaku shita bun no shukuhakudai wo henkin shite kudasai" tte itta n desu ne.	 [07:32,6]
    "We checked in today, but we're checking out,   [07:32,6]
    so please refund the accommodation fee we booked."   [07:36,7]
- jaa, nan ka okorarete,	 [07:42,1]
    Well, then I got scolded,   [07:42,1]
- chotto okotte "iya, sonna koto dekinai yo" tte iwareta n desu ne.	 [07:46,0]
    They got a little angry, and they said, "No, we can't do that."   [07:46,0]
- de,Booking.comde yoyaku shita n desukedo,	 [07:52,7]
    So, I called Booking.com's customer service in Japan.   [07:52,7]
- sonoBooking.comno nihon no kasutamaa saabisu ni denwa shita n desu yo.	 [07:56,4]
- jaa, sono kata wa honto ni yasashikute,	 [08:01,1]
    Then, that person was really kind,   [08:01,1]
- "aa sore wa, honto ni taihen deshita ne.	 [08:04,8]
    "Oh, that must have been really tough.   [08:04,8]
- nemurenakatta no wa, sugoku taihen datta to omou n desukedo, taichou daijoubu desu ka"	 [08:07,9]
    It must have been really hard not being able to sleep. Are you okay?"   [08:07,9]
- tte itte kureta n desu yo.	 [08:12,8]
    She said that to me.   [08:12,8]
- mou, sono kotoba de naki sou ni natte,	 [08:14,1]
    Well, with those words, I felt like crying, and   [08:14,1]
- yappari nihonjin no kasutamaa saabisu to ka sekkyaku tte, honto ni teinei dashi, yasashii na to omoimashita.	 [08:17,7]
    I thought Japanese customer service and hospitality are really polite and kind.   [08:17,7]
- sonna koto, betsu ni iwanakute mo iija nai desu ka "ootake deshita ka" to ka "taihen deshita ne" to ka.	 [08:28,8]
    You don't necessarily need to say such things like "Are you okay?" or "It must have been tough."   [08:28,8]
- de mo, honto ni sono kata wa "honto ni daijoubu desu ka" tte kiite kurete,	 [08:34,4]
    But that person really asked, "Are you really okay?"   [08:34,4]
- aa, yappari nihon no kasutamaa saabisu wa ii na to omoimashita.	 [08:39,6]
    Ah, I thought, "Japanese customer service is really nice."   [08:39,6]
- de, sou iu hoteru to ka, kuukou to ka dake ja nakute,	 [08:44,4]
    And, not only in hotels or airports,   [08:44,4]
- doko ni itte mo, minna yasashii na tte iu no wa, itsu mo omoimasu.	 [08:49,9]
    I always feel that people are kind wherever I go.   [08:49,9]
- tatoeba konbini no ten'insan to ka,	 [08:56,9]
    For example, convenience store clerks,   [08:56,9]
- chuurinjou, jitensha wo oku tokoro ni iru ojisan to ka,	 [09:00,0]
    Old men at the bicycle parking lot,   [09:00,0]
- kousoku no ryoukinsho, kousoku de okane wo harau tokoro ni tatte iru hito to ka,	 [09:04,9]
    people standing at the toll booth on the highway,   [09:04,9]
- honto ni ne, doko de mo, minna yasashii na tte iu inshou ga arimasu.	 [09:13,4]
    Really, everywhere, everyone is kind, that's the impression I have.   [09:13,4]
- dakara, suki desu.	 [09:18,9]
    So, I like it.   [09:18,9]
- sou, de, minnachan to suru n desu yo ne.	 [09:23,5]
    Yes, and everyone does their job properly, right?   [09:23,5]
- jibun no shigoto wa, sekinin wo motte suru tte iu kangaekata ga nihon ni wa aru no de,	 [09:25,7]
    Having the mindset of doing your job responsibly is something that exists in Japan,   [09:25,7]
- kou, tekitou ni shinai.	 [09:35,8]
    not doing things with half hearted effort.   [09:35,8]
- de, motto wakai koro wa,	 [09:38,5]
    And when I was younger,   [09:38,5]
- na n darou na, kaigai no sou iu anmari teinei ja nai sekkyaku to ka mo, omoshiroi na tte omotte(i)ta n desukedo,	 [09:40,4]
    I used to find it interesting, the not-so-polite customer service in other countries,   [09:40,4]
- saikin wa, yappari chanto shigoto wo suru to ka, chanto teinei ni suru tte iu koto ga, sugoku daiji da na to omou you ni natta no de,	 [09:49,4]
    but recently, I've come to think that doing your job properly and politely is really important,   [09:49,4]
- nihonjin no sou iu tokoro wa, daisuki desu.	 [10:02,3]
    so I love that aspect of Japanese people.   [10:02,3]
- tsugi, yottsume.	 [10:05,8]
    Next, the fourth one.   [10:05,8]
- yottsume wa, michi ni gomibako ga nai no ni, michi ga kirei tte iu koto desu.	 [10:07,1]
    The fourth one is that there are no trash cans on the streets, yet the streets are clean.   [10:07,1]
- maa, sou desu ne. gomi wa jibun de motte kaeru tte iu kangaekata ga, nihonjin wa tsuyoi no ka na to omoimasu.	 [10:13,5]
    Well, yes. I think Japanese people have a strong mentality of taking their own trash home.   [10:13,5]
- maa, mochiron poisute suru hito mo iru n desukedo,	 [10:22,9]
    Of course, there are people who litter,   [10:22,9]
- kihonteki ni, jibun no gomi wa, chanto jibun de motte kaeru tte iu shuukan ga aru you na ki ga shimasu.	 [10:25,4]
    but basically, there seems to be a habit of taking your own trash home.   [10:25,4]
- dakara, gomibako ga michi ni nakute mo,	 [10:35,2]
    So, even if there are no trash cans on the streets,   [10:35,2]
- michi ga kirei na n desu yo ne, itsu mo. sou.	 [10:39,0]
    the streets are always clean..   [10:39,0]
- sou iu ookii machi, tatoeba tokyo to ka ni itte mo,	 [10:43,1]
    Even in big cities like Tokyo,   [10:43,1]
- michi ga kirei tte iu no wa, atarimae da to omotte(i)ta n desukedo, nihon ni sunde(i)ta toki wa.	 [10:47,3]
    I used to think that clean streets were normal when I lived in Japan.   [10:47,3]
- de mo kaigai ni kite hajimete, a,, kore tte sugoi koto na n da na to omoimashita.	 [10:54,3]
    But coming abroad for the first time, I realized that this is really amazing.   [10:54,3]
- de, nihon de wa tokidoki, asa aruite iruto,	 [11:00,5]
    And sometimes when I'm walking in the morning in Japan,   [11:00,5]
- borantia de, gomi wo hirotte(i)ru hito ga iru n desu ne.	 [11:04,6]
    there are people volunteering to pick up trash.   [11:04,6]
- maa, mochiron kaigai ni mo iru to omou n desukedo,	 [11:08,3]
    Well, of course, there are such people abroad too,   [11:08,3]
- sou iu nihonjin no, minna de machi wo kirei ni shiyou tte iu kangaekata mo, ii na to omoimashita.	 [11:11,2]
    butI think the Japanese mindset of everyone cleaning the town together is nice.   [11:11,2]
- maa ne, tokidoki gomibako ga nai no wa, fuben da na to omou n desukedo,	 [11:21,5]
    Well, sometimes it's inconvenient that there are no trash cans,   [11:21,5]
- sou, de mo michi ga kirei na no wa, honto ni ii desu ne.	 [11:25,8]
    but yes, it's really nice that the streets are clean.   [11:25,8]
- hai, jaa, tsugi.	 [11:28,6]
    Yes, so, next.   [11:28,6]
- tsugi wa, koukyou koutsuu kikan ga hattatsu shite ite,	 [11:29,5]
    Next is that public transportation is well-developed,   [11:29,5]
- kuruma wo unten shinakute mo ii koto desu.	 [11:33,8]
    and you don't need to drive a car.   [11:33,8]
- kore wa, ookii desu ne.	 [11:37,2]
    This is a big one.   [11:37,2]
- maa, watashi wa kuruma wo unten shinai no de,	 [11:39,1]
    Well, I don't drive a car,   [11:39,1]
- kore wa, watashi ni totte ookii desu.	 [11:42,6]
    so this is big for me.   [11:42,6]
- densha to basu to jitensha dake de doko ni de mo ikeru tte iu no wa, jiyuu wo kanjimasu ne, honto ni.	 [11:47,0]
    Being able to go anywhere by train, bus, and bicycle makes me feel free, really.   [11:47,0]
- tokuni kuruma shakai no kuni dattara,	 [11:56,4]
    Especially in a country where driving is common,   [11:56,4]
- honto ni, doko ni iku ni mo kuruma wo unten shinaito ikenaija nai desu ka.	 [11:58,5]
    you really have to drive everywhere.   [11:58,5]
- de mo, nihon da to kihonteki ni...	 [12:04,3]
    But in Japan, basically...   [12:04,3]
- maa, basho ni mo yoru n desukedo,	 [12:07,3]
    Well, it depends on the place,   [12:07,3]
- tatoeba okinawa wa, kuruma shakai.	 [12:09,6]
    for example, Okinawa is a car society.   [12:09,6]
- dakara, kuruma ga hitsuyou na n desukedo,	 [12:11,8]
    So, a car is necessary there,   [12:11,8]
- kyoto to ka, tokyo to ka, sou desu ne.	 [12:14,7]
    but in places like Kyoto or Tokyo,   [12:14,7]
- sou iu machi ni sumuto, kuruma wa hitsuyou nai no de,	 [12:18,9]
    Living in such cities, a car is not necessary,   [12:18,9]
- sore wa, ookii na to omoimasu.	 [12:24,4]
    That's something I find significant.   [12:24,4]
- kuruma ga hitsuyou ja nai dake ja nakute,	 [12:26,3]
    Not just because you don't need a car,   [12:26,3]
- shinkansen ni noreba, doko ni de mo sugu ikeru tte iu koto mo, ookina to omoimasu.	 [12:29,2]
    but also because you can easily go anywhere by taking the Shinkansen (bullet train).   [12:29,2]
- yappari chiisai kuni dakara, idou shiyasui desu ne.	 [12:36,0]
    Because Japan is compact, it's easy to move around.   [12:36,0]
- ookii kuni dato,	 [12:39,8]
    In larger countries,   [12:39,8]
- chigau machi ni iku dake de, kekkou jikan kakaruja nai desu ka.	 [12:41,2]
    just going to a different town takes quite a bit of time, right?   [12:41,2]
- de mo, nihon wa konpakuto na no de,	 [12:44,7]
    But in Japan, it's compact,   [12:44,7]
- densha to ka, shinkansen de doko ni de mo ikeru no wa, sugoku suki desu.	 [12:47,4]
    and being able to go anywhere by train or Shinkansen is something I really like.   [12:47,4]
- benri da na to omoimasu.	 [12:53,8]
    I find it convenient.   [12:53,8]
- dakara, chigau machi ni sunde iru tomodachi ni ai ni iku no mo, sonna ni muzukashiku nai.	 [12:56,2]
    So, even going to see friends in a different town is not that difficult.   [12:56,2]
- sore wa, ii na to omoimasu.	 [13:04,1]
    I think that's nice.   [13:04,1]
- hai, jaa tsugi, muttsume.	 [13:05,8]
    Yes, so, next, the sixth one.   [13:05,8]
- muttsume wa, shiki ga atte, gyouji mo takusan arukara, tanoshimeru.	 [13:08,2]
    The sixth one is that there are four seasons, and there are many events, so it's enjoyable.   [13:08,2]
- maa, mochiron, ta no kuni de mo shiki ga aru kuni wa, takusan aru no de,	 [13:14,5]
    Well, of course, there are many countries with four seasons,   [13:14,5]
- "nihon ni wa shiki ga arimasu yo. nihon dake desu yo" tte itte(i)ru n ja nai n desukedo,	 [13:19,7]
    I'm not saying Japan is the only country with four seasons,   [13:19,7]
- nihon no ii tokoro wa, sono kisetsu ni yotte ironna gyouji ga aru tte iu koto desu.	 [13:24,2]
    but what's nice about Japan is that there are various events according to each season.   [13:24,2]
- tatoeba haru ga kuruto, minna sakura wo tanoshimi ni shimasu ne.	 [13:29,9]
    For example, when spring comes, everyone looks forward to cherry blossoms.   [13:29,9]
- de, sakura no kisetsu ga kuruto,	 [13:37,0]
    And when the cherry blossom season comes,   [13:37,0]
- minna de ohanami shi tari, asa no sanpo de sakura wo tanoshin dari,	 [13:39,2]
    people enjoy cherry blossom viewing, morning walks to enjoy cherry blossoms,   [13:39,2]
- sou iu ichi nen ni i kai no tanoshimi ga atte, sugoku ii na to omoimasu.	 [13:44,1]
    I think that's really nice to have such once-a-year pleasures.   [13:44,1]
- natsu ni naruto, omatsuri ga arushi, hanabi ga arushi,	 [13:52,0]
    In summer, there are festivals and fireworks,   [13:52,0]
- aki ni naruto, kouyou ga tanoshimerushi,	 [13:55,8]
    in autumn, you can enjoy autumn leaves,   [13:55,8]
- fuyu ni naruto, yukimatsuri to ka,	 [13:58,7]
    and in winter, there are snow festivals,   [13:58,7]
- maa, sukii to ka sunoboo wo suru hito wa, sou iu fuyu no supootsu wo tanoshime tari to ka,	 [14:02,2]
    well, for those who do skiing and snowboarding can enjoy winter sports,   [14:02,2]
- nee, sou iu fuu ni kisetsu ni yotte, tanoshimeru koto ga aru, tanoshii ibento ga aru tte iu no wa, tanoshii desu ne.	 [14:08,0]
    there are enjoyable events according to the seasons, and it's fun.   [14:08,0]
- honto ni akinai desu.	 [14:17,7]
    I never get bored.   [14:17,7]
- ironna gyouji ga aru koto wa, sugoku ii na to omoimasu.	 [14:19,3]
    Having various events is really nice.   [14:19,3]
- hai, jaa tsugi, dondon ikimashou.	 [14:23,4]
    Yes, so, let's move on.   [14:23,4]
- ee, nanatsume.	 [14:26,2]
    Um, the seventh one.   [14:26,2]
- nanatsume wa, shizuka dakara ochitsuku tte iu koto desu.	 [14:28,2]
    The seventh one is that it's quiet, so it's calming.   [14:28,2]
- maa ne, kore wa ne, sono basho ni mo yoru to omoimasu.	 [14:33,5]
    Well, this depends on the place, I think.   [14:33,5]
- tatoeba osaka no doutonbori to ka ni ikuto, shizuka ja nai no de,	 [14:36,8]
    For example, if you go to Dotonbori in Osaka, it's not quiet,   [14:36,8]
- watashi wa, ochitsukanai n desukedo,	 [14:41,4]
    so I don't feel calm there,   [14:41,4]
- kihonteki ni, tatoeba densha ni notte mo, minna shizuka desu yo ne.	 [14:43,5]
    but basically, even when you ride the train, everyone is quiet, right?   [14:43,5]
- de, otera to ka jinja ni itte mo, nihonjin minna shizuka na n desu yo.	 [14:48,4]
    And when you go to temples and shrines, Japanese people are quiet.   [14:48,4]
- nanka, mawari no hito no koto wo sugoku kangaete(i)ru hito ga ookute,	 [14:55,0]
    There are a lot of people who really think about others around them,   [14:55,0]
- anmari, sono ba no fun'iki wo kowasanai you ni suru bunka ga aru na to omoimashita.	 [15:01,7]
    and there's a culture of not disturbing the atmosphere too much.   [15:01,7]
- maa, osaka wa, chotto reigai da na to omou n desukedo,	 [15:08,8]
    Well, I think Osaka is a bit of an exception,   [15:08,8]
- osakajin wa, oshaberi na no de,	 [15:12,9]
    Osakans are talkative, (I’m from Osaka and I love Osakans)   [15:12,9]
- osaka de densha ni noruto,	 [15:15,3]
    so when you ride the train in Osaka,   [15:15,3]
- tokyo ni kurabete, kekkou ookii koe de shabette(i)ru hito ga iru n desukedo,	 [15:17,7]
    compared to Tokyo, there are people talking quite loudly,(I’m from Osaka and I love Osakans)   [15:17,7]
- n-, densha dake ja nakute,	 [15:24,2]
    uh, not just on the train,   [15:24,2]
- sou desu ne. yappari jinja to ka otera ni ikuto,	 [15:27,2]
    well, when you go to shrines and temples,   [15:27,2]
- minna shizuka na no wa ii na to omoimasu.	 [15:31,5]
    I think it's nice that everyone is quiet.   [15:31,5]
- maa, kore wa, sono hito no konomi da to omoimasu.	 [15:34,5]
    Well, I think this depends on personal preference.   [15:34,5]
- nigiyaka na tokoro ga suki na hito mo ireba,	 [15:37,5]
    Some people like lively places,   [15:37,5]
- kekkou shizuka na tokoro no hou ga ochitsuku tte iu hito mo iru to omou no de,	 [15:40,6]
    while others find quiet places more calming,   [15:40,6]
- hito ni yoru to omou n desukedo,	 [15:44,9]
    so it depends on the person,   [15:44,9]
- watashi wa, sou desu ne. nihon no shizuka na fun'iki ga kekkou suki desu.	 [15:46,6]
    but for me, I like the calm atmosphere in Japan.   [15:46,6]
- hai, jaa tsugi, 8kome.	 [15:55,8]
    Yes, so, next, the eighth one.   [15:55,8]
- bunka ga fukakute omoshiroi.	 [15:57,9]
    The eighth one is that the culture is deep and interesting.   [15:57,9]
- nihon go wo benkyou shite(i)ru hito no naka ni mo, kekkou nihon bunka ga suki tte iu hito ga ooi n desukedo,	 [16:01,1]
    Among people studying Japanese, many seem to like Japanese culture,   [16:01,1]
- honto ni watashi mo daisuki de,	 [16:08,6]
    and I really love it too, and   [16:08,6]
- madamada shiranai koto mo, takusan aru na to kanjimasu.	 [16:12,3]
    I feel that there are still many things I don't know.   [16:12,3]
- tokuni sadou to ka, seika to ka, sou iu koto wo yarasete moratta koto mo aru n desukedo,	 [16:17,5]
    Especially, I've had the opportunity to experience things like tea ceremony and flower arranging,   [16:17,5]
- oku ga fukakute,	 [16:26,2]
    and they are profound.   [16:26,2]
- sono hitotsu hitotsu no ugoki to ka, sono hitotsu hitotsu no purosesu ni imi ga aru no de,	 [16:29,3]
    Each movement and each process has meaning,   [16:29,3]
- sou iu koto wo, soko made fukaku kiwameta mukashi no nihonjin wa, sugoi na tte omoimasu.	 [16:38,8]
    so I think ancient Japanese people who mastered such things deeply were amazing.   [16:38,8]
- dakara, sou iu nihonjin ga taisetsu ni shite kita koto to ka wo motto benkyou shitaishi,	 [16:48,8]
    So, I want to study more about what these Japanese people valued,   [16:48,8]
- motto manabitai na to omoimasu.	 [16:54,8]
    and I want to learn more.   [16:54,8]
- madamada watashi mo shiranai koto bakkari na no de,	 [16:57,6]
    Since there are still many things I don't know,   [16:57,6]
- kore kara nihon ni sunde, ironna koto wo manande,	 [17:00,9]
    I want to live in Japan, learn various things,   [17:00,9]
- ironna koto wo minasan ni shea dekiru you ni shitai na to omotte imasu.	 [17:05,1]
    and share them with everyone.   [17:05,1]
- maa, watashi wa, nihon go wo oshiete(i)ru n desukedo,	 [17:10,7]
    Well, I teach Japanese,   [17:10,7]
- nihon go mo, sugoku fukai gengo da na to omoimasu.	 [17:13,5]
    And I think the Japanese language itself is a very deep language.   [17:13,5]
- dakara, maa minasan ni mo, sou iu nihon go no utsukushisa to ka wo shea dekiru you ni, kore kara ganbaritai desu.	 [17:18,8]
    So, I want to do my best to share the beauty of the Japanese language with everyone.   [17:18,8]
- jaa tsugi, tsugi ikimashou.	 [17:31,0]
    Now, let's move on to the next one.   [17:31,0]
- tsugi, nan da kke?	 [17:34,0]
    What's next?   [17:34,0]
- tsugi wa, kodomo ga hitori de michi wo arukeru gurai anzen na kuni tte iu koto desu.	 [17:35,3]
    Next is that it's a country where children can walk alone on the streets safely.   [17:35,3]
- kore wa, watashi wa, kodomo no koro kara zutto sou datta no de,	 [17:42,1]
    This has been the case for me since childhood,   [17:42,1]
- atarimae da to omotte(i)ta n desukedo,	 [17:47,8]
    so I thought I took it for granted, but.   [17:47,8]
- maa, supein ni mo sunda koto ga arushi,	 [17:50,4]
    I've also lived in Spain,   [17:50,4]
- mekishiko ni mo sunda koto ga arushi,	 [17:53,3]
    I've lived in Mexico,   [17:53,3]
- ima wa, amerika ni 3 kagetsu taizai shite(i)ru n desukedo,	 [17:55,5]
    and now, I'm staying in the U.S. for three months,   [17:55,5]
- yappari, doko ni itte mo, kodomo dake de wa inai n desu yo ne.	 [17:59,3]
    but wherever you go, children are not alone.   [17:59,3]
- zettai ni otona ga issho ni iru n desu yo.	 [18:05,2]
    There is always an adult with them.   [18:05,2]
- de mo, nihon tte, honto ni kouen ni ikuto, kodomo dake de asonde(i)rushi,	 [18:09,2]
    But in Japan, when you go to a park, children play alone,   [18:09,2]
- kodomo ga, hitori de densha ni notte gakkou ni itte(i)ru tokoro mo mirushi,	 [18:14,6]
    you can see children going to school alone on the train,   [18:14,6]
- honto ni ne, anzen da na to omoimasu.	 [18:20,4]
    so it's really safe.   [18:20,4]
- dakara, kosodate shiyasui basho de wa aru na to omoimasu ne.	 [18:24,1]
    So, I think it's a place where it's easy to raise children.   [18:24,1]
- maa, kodomo dake ja nakute,	 [18:30,1]
    Well, not just children,   [18:30,1]
- josei mo yoru, anshin shite soto wo arukeru kuni dakara,	 [18:32,2]
    women can walk outside at night with peace of mind,   [18:32,2]
- sore wa, honto ni ookii na to omoimasu.	 [18:38,1]
    so I think that's really significant.   [18:38,1]
- watashi ni totte jiyuu wa, kekkou daiji na no de,	 [18:40,2]
    For me, freedom is quite important,   [18:40,2]
- jiyuu ni, yoru onaka ga suita toki ni, konbini ni ikeru koto to ka,	 [18:43,3]
    being able to go to the convenience store when hungry at night freely,   [18:43,3]
- sore ga, ichiban ookii desu ne.	 [18:49,4]
    that's the biggest thing.   [18:49,4]
- jiyuu ni konbini ikeru koto,	 [18:50,7]
    Being able to go to the convenience store freely,   [18:50,7]
- de, itsu de mo konbini de aisu wo katte tabe(ra)reru koto to ka,	 [18:54,0]
    and being able to buy and eat ice cream at the convenience store anytime, those are small things but nice.   [18:54,0]
- sou iu koto wa, sugoku chiisai koto na n desukedo, ii na to omoimasu.	 [18:58,7]
    I think it's nice.   [19:02,8]
- kaigai ni iku made wa, atarimae da to omotte(i)ta n desukedo,	 [19:05,4]
    Until I went abroad, I thought it was normal,   [19:05,4]
- yappari nihon wa, anzen desu ne.	 [19:09,4]
    but Japan is indeed safe.   [19:09,4]
- hai, saigo.	 [19:11,5]
    Yes, the last one.   [19:11,5]
- saigo wa, saifu to ka keitai wo otoshite mo,	 [19:12,5]
    The last one is that even if you drop your wallet or phone,   [19:12,5]
- kanari takai kakuritsu de kaette kuru tte iu koto desu.	 [19:17,1]
    there's a pretty high chance it will be returned.   [19:17,1]
- kore wa, watashi ni totte wa, kekkou ookikute,	 [19:20,9]
    For me, this is quite significant,   [19:20,9]
- watashi, kekkou mono(wo)naku su n desu yo.	 [19:24,6]
    I tend to lose things a lot.   [19:24,6]
- ima made, saifu to keitai otoshite kaette konakatta koto ga nai n desu yo.	 [19:27,3]
    I've never had a case where my wallet or phone didn't come back.   [19:27,3]
- chikaku no kouban to ka, eki ni denwa suruto,	 [19:34,4]
    If you call the nearby police box or station,   [19:34,4]
- zettai, dare ka saifu to ka keitai wo todokete kurete(i)ru n desu yo ne.	 [19:38,2]
    someone will definitely bring your wallet or phone.   [19:38,2]
- honto ni yasashii na to omoimasu.	 [19:42,8]
    I really think it's kind.   [19:42,8]
- de, ichi kai keitai otoshita toki wa,	 [19:46,0]
    And one time when I dropped my phone once,   [19:46,0]
- watashi ga, tabun otoshita tokoro kara ichiban chikai kouban made, kekkou tooi kyori datta n desukedo,	 [19:48,1]
    from where I probably dropped it to the nearest police box was quite a distance,   [19:48,1]
- soko made, wazawaza hirotta hito ga todokete kurete,	 [19:58,6]
    someone went out of their way to pick it up and deliver it,   [19:58,6]
- honto ni, nante ii kuni na n da to omoimashita.	 [20:03,4]
    and I thought, "What a wonderful country."   [20:03,4]
- maa, sekaichuu doko ni itte mo, yasashii hito wa takusan iru to omou n desukedo,	 [20:08,1]
    Well, I think there are kind people everywhere in the world,   [20:08,1]
- kore ni kanshite wa, yappari kaigai de mono wo otosuto,	 [20:13,3]
    but regarding this, when you lose something abroad,   [20:13,3]
- torarete shimau koto no hou ga ooi to omou no de,	 [20:19,8]
    I think the chances of it being taken are higher,   [20:19,8]
- sou iu nihonjin no yasashii tokoro to ka, nihon no chian no yosa wa, honto ni kansha shinaito ikenai na to omoimasu.	 [20:25,9]
    so I really feel grateful for the kindness of the Japanese and the safety of Japan.   [20:25,9]
- hai, to iu koto de, kore ga, watashi ga nihon ni sumitai riyuu desu.	 [20:35,2]
    Yes, so that's why I want to live in Japan.   [20:35,2]
- mochiron, nihon mo kanpeki na kuni de wa nai no de,	 [20:39,6]
    Of course, Japan is not a perfect country,   [20:39,6]
- kaizen dekiru tokoro wa, takusan aru to omou n desukedo,	 [20:42,8]
    and I think there are many areas that can be improved,   [20:42,8]
- watashi ni totte, nihon wa sumiyasui tokoro da na to, kotoshi kizukimashita.	 [20:46,4]
