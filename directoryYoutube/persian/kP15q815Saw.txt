- dar guše va kenār jahān ,	 [00:00,6]
    All around the world,   [00:00,6]
- mārijāvān dar hāl jorm zodāyi yā hati qānuni šodan ast.	 [00:02,1]
    marijuana is being decriminalized, or even made legal.   [00:02,1]
- omā vāqe`an fekr xobiye ?	 [00:06,0]
    But is this really a good idea?   [00:06,0]
- dar monāzerāt ānlāyn ,	 [00:08,6]
    In the online debate,   [00:08,6]
- aqlab janbe hāy āsib zā kamrang tar joluh dāde mey šavad.	 [00:10,0]
    the harmful sides are often downplayed.   [00:10,0]
- pas biyāyid negāhi biyāndāzim be se tā az qavi terin estedlālāh	 [00:12,2]
    So let's look at the three most powerful arguments   [00:12,2]
- dar moxālefat bā qānuni šodan mārijāvān.	 [00:15,1]
    against legalizing marijuana.   [00:15,1]
    [Intro - Kurzgesagt]   [00:17,7]
- estedlāl šomāre yek :	 [00:25,2]
    Argument number 1:   [00:25,2]
- dar te^ye čand dahe gozašte ,	 [00:27,3]
    In the last few decades,   [00:27,3]
- mārijāvān betor peyvaste barā^ye afzāyeš qodrat asar mohandesi šode ast.	 [00:28,5]
    marijuana has been engineered to become much more potent.   [00:28,5]
- dar hāl hāzer , mārijāvān ānqadr qavi šode ast ke ,	 [00:32,0]
    Today, marijuana is so potent,   [00:32,0]
- dar vāqe` dāruyi qavi ast ke mey tavānad monjar be ravān pariši (sāykuzis) šavad.	 [00:34,6]
    that it's actually a strong drug that may cause psychosis.   [00:34,6]
- māde moser asli mārijāvān THC ast ,	 [00:37,7]
    The main active ingredient of marijuana is THC,   [00:37,7]
- va šavāhed qavi az ertebāt THC bā ravān pariši ,	 [00:41,4]
    and there's strong evidence that THC is related to psychosis   [00:41,4]
- fāreq az sāyere avāmel xatar , vojud dārad.	 [00:45,4]
    regardless of other risk factors.   [00:45,4]
- mārijāvān hamčenin dārāye māde digari be nām CBD ast ,	 [00:48,1]
    Marijuana also contains a substance called CBD,   [00:48,1]
- ke be nazar mirsad dar jahat xonsā kardan asar kali ānset.	 [00:51,1]
    that seems to counteract its effect.   [00:51,1]
- in māde hati be onvān darmāni barā^ye ravān pariši va ezterāb mored āzmāyeš qarār gerefte ,	 [00:53,3]
    It's even being tested as a treatment against psychosis and anxiety.   [00:53,3]
- va^li az ānjā ke nemi tavānad sarxoši (high) ijād kanad ,	 [00:58,3]
    But because it doesn't make you high,   [00:58,3]
- amal āvarandegān kam kam mizān CBD dar mārijāvān rā	 [01:00,3]
    growers have gradually decreased the amount of CBD   [01:00,3]
- te^ye čand dahe gozašte kāheš dādand ,	 [01:03,3]
    in marijuana over the last few decades,   [01:03,3]
- va az ānsu maqādir THC rā bālā bordand.	 [01:05,5]
    while increasing THC levels.   [01:05,5]
- nemune bardāri hā nešān mey dahand ke mizān THC az čāhār darsad dar dahe navad milādi ,	 [01:08,6]
- be hudud davāzdah darsad dar sāl do hezār va čāhārdah raside ,	 [01:13,9]
    Sample testing showed that THC levels have risen from around 4% in the 1990s to nearly 12% in 2014,   [01:08,6]
    to nearly 12% in 2014,   [01:13,9]
- betori ke nesbat THC be CBD az čāhārdah be yek dar sāl yek hezār va nahsad va navad va panj ,	 [01:16,3]
    shifting the ratio of THC to CBD from 1:14 in 1995   [01:16,3]
- be haštād be yek dar sāl do hezār va čāhārdah afzāyeš yāfte ast.	 [01:21,4]
    to about 1:80 in 2014.   [01:21,4]
- a^lbate čandān rošan nist ke in tastahā čeqadr daqiq bude and.	 [01:24,9]
    It's unclear how precise those tests were, however.   [01:24,9]
- dar majmu` , yāfte hāy axir nešān mey dahand ke har če mārijānāye bištari masraf kanid ,	 [01:28,7]
    Overall, recent findings suggest that the more marijuana you consume,   [01:28,7]
- va har če qavi tar bāšad ,	 [01:32,8]
    and the stronger it is,   [01:32,8]
- xatar ebtelā be ravān pariši bālātar ast.	 [01:34,1]
    the higher your risk of developing psychosis.   [01:34,1]
- hālā kalā xatar ravān pariši dar jam`iyat sālem čeqadr ast ?	 [01:37,2]
    But how high is the risk of psychosis for the general population?   [01:37,2]
- motāle`e ey dar beritāniyā be in yāfte rasid ke	 [01:41,4]
    A study from Britain found that   [01:41,4]
- bā vojud afzāyeš qābel toje masraf mārijāvān beyn sālhāy yek hezār va nahsad va navad va šeš tā do hezār va panj ,	 [01:42,8]
    while marijuana use has risen significantly between 1996 and 2005,   [01:42,8]
- te`dād mavāred eskizoferni –	 [01:48,3]
    the number of schizophrenia cases –   [01:48,3]
- no` az ravān parāyeši – taqriban sābet bāqi mānde ast.	 [01:50,3]
    a type of psychosis – remain stable.   [01:50,3]
- xatar ravān pariši nāši az masraf mārijāvān ,	 [01:53,3]
    The risk of marijuana induced psychosis   [01:53,3]
- dar beyn efrādi az hame bištar ast ke ,	 [01:56,2]
    remains the highest for people   [01:56,2]
- ke kalā bištar mosta`ed ravān pariši hastand.	 [01:57,8]
    who already have a high risk of psychosis to begin with.   [01:57,8]
- in farza mohtamal tar be nazar mirsad ke dar in afrād ,	 [02:01,7]
    For them, it seems more likely that   [02:01,7]
- mārijāvān bā`es mašud alāyem ravān pariši sari` tar zāher šavand ,	 [02:03,5]
    marijuana speeds up the development of their condition,   [02:03,5]
- tā i^nke mārijāvān bā`es ān šavad , motābeqe atlā`āti ke tā alān dārim.	 [02:06,1]
    rather than causing it, as far as we know right now.   [02:06,1]
- estedlāl intor mey guyad ke ,	 [02:09,7]
    So the reasoning goes,   [02:09,7]
- a^gar afrād kamtari be mārijāvān dastresi dāšte bāšand ,	 [02:11,3]
    if fewer people have access to marijuana,   [02:11,3]
- xatar ravān pariši nāši az mārijāvān kamtar mey šavad.	 [02:13,7]
    the lower the risk of marijuana-induced psychosis.   [02:13,7]
- omā dar vāqe` , šomā mey tavānid intor estedlāl kanid ke	 [02:16,6]
    But actually, you could argue that   [02:16,6]
- daqikā bexātere i^nke mārijāvān qeyreqānuni ast ,	 [02:18,5]
    precisely because marijuana is illegal,   [02:18,5]
- afrād bištari dočār ravān pariši mey šavand.	 [02:21,3]
    more people will end up with psychosis.   [02:21,3]
- mamnu`it bā`es mey šavad ke mavād qeyreqānuni qavi tar sāxte šavand ,	 [02:24,6]
    Prohibition makes illegal drug stronger and more potent,   [02:24,6]
- čon bā in kār mey tavān mahsul bištari rā dar fazāyi kamtar haml kord ,	 [02:27,6]
    because this way you can ship more product in a smaller space   [02:27,6]
- va bā sud bištari foruxt.	 [02:31,1]
    and sell it at a greater profit.   [02:31,1]
- in etfāqi ast ke dar dore mamnu`it alkel dar iyālāt motehede rox dād ,	 [02:33,4]
    This is what happened during the prohibition of alcohol in the US,   [02:33,4]
- tori ke mašrubāhi taqtiri (hāvi alkel bālātar) ma`mul šodand.	 [02:36,7]
    where hard liquor became the norm.   [02:36,7]
- va ha^min etfāq alān barā^ye mārijāvān dārad mey oftad.	 [02:39,4]
    And the same is happening with marijuana now.   [02:39,4]
- daniyāyi rā tasavar kanid ke mašrubāhi taqtiri tanhā gozine nušidani hāy alkoli bāšand ,	 [02:42,3]
    Imagine a world where liquor is the only alcohol available.   [02:42,3]
- šomā in entexāb rā dārid ke yā aslan mast nakanid ,	 [02:46,2]
    You have the choice of either not drinking at all,   [02:46,2]
- yā besiyār mast tar az ānče ke mixāstid bešuyad.	 [02:48,8]
    or getting much drunker than you would like to.   [02:48,8]
- zo`eyat barā^ye besyāri az masraf konandegān mārijāvān dar hāl hāzer čenin ast.	 [02:51,4]
    This is the situation for many marijuana smokers today.   [02:51,4]
- mordam masraf alkel rā dar dore mamnu`it qat` nakardand ,	 [02:55,2]
    People didn't stop drinking during prohibition,   [02:55,2]
- va arqām nešān mey dahand ke qavānin mordam rā az masraf mārijāvān bāz nemi dārad.	 [02:58,0]
    and the numbers show that laws don't deter people from using marijuana.   [02:58,0]
- mā nemi tavānim mas`ale mārijāvān rā kalā hazf kanim ,	 [03:02,0]
    We can't make marijuana go away,   [03:02,0]
- va^li mitovān xatrāt ān rā kāheš dād.	 [03:04,4]
    but we can make it safer.   [03:04,4]
- va^qti mārijāvān qānuni bāšad ,	 [03:06,8]
    If marijuana were legal,   [03:06,8]
- masraf konandegān gozine hāy bištari dārand ,	 [03:08,3]
    there would be more options for consumers,   [03:08,3]
- va qavānin nezārati mitevānand , barā^ye mesāl , maqādir bālāy CBD rā elzāmi kanand.	 [03:10,7]
    and regulators could, for example, insist on a high level of CBD.   [03:10,7]
- ha^māntor ke aksar afrād ba`d az kār yek betori vodkā nemi nušand ,	 [03:15,3]
    Just like most people don't drink an after-work bottle of vodka,   [03:15,3]
- xeyli afrād māyel  bud ke mārijānāyi mo`ādel ābjoy ba`d az kār , masraf kanand.	 [03:19,1]
    many people would gladly consume the after-work beer version of marijuana.   [03:19,1]
- estedlāl šomāre do : mārijāvān yek darvāze vorud (be e`teyā` be mavād digar) ast.	 [03:24,6]
    Argument 2: Marijuana is a gateway drug.   [03:24,6]
- a^gar qānuni šavad ,	 [03:28,0]
    If it's legalized,   [03:28,0]
- afzāyeši nāhegāni dar masraf mavād xatarnākatr rox mey dahad.	 [03:29,2]
    there will be a spike in the use of much more dangerous drugs.   [03:29,2]
- motāle`e ey dar sāl do hezār va pānzdah be in yāfte rasid ke	 [03:34,1]
    A 2015 study found that   [03:34,1]
- hudud čehl va panj darsad az masraf konandegān dā`emi mārijāvān ,	 [03:35,9]
    about 45% of lifelong marijuana users   [03:35,9]
- zamāni yek māde qeyr qānuni digar rā masraf karde and.	 [03:38,9]
    took some other illegal drug at some point.   [03:38,9]
- qānuni kardan mārijāvān mey tavānad in ravand rā tašdid kanad :	 [03:42,3]
    Legalizing marijuana could reinforce this trend:   [03:42,3]
- javānān bištari mārijānāye qānuni rā emtehān mey kanand ,	 [03:45,3]
    As more young people try legal marijuana,   [03:45,3]
- ke momken ast be emtehān kardan mavād xatarnākatr tan bedahand.	 [03:47,9]
    they might end up trying harder drugs.   [03:47,9]
- va^li ma`lum mey šavad ke darvāze vorud asli be masraf mavād maxdar qabl tar az inhāst :	 [03:50,6]
    But it turns out that the real gateway to drug use comes much earlier:   [03:50,6]
- sigār	 [03:55,1]
    Cigarettes.   [03:55,1]
- yek motāle`e nešān dāde ke	 [03:56,5]
    One study showed that   [03:56,5]
- nojavāniyā ke qabl az pānzdah sālegi sigār kešidan rā āqāz kardand ,	 [03:58,0]
    teens who started smoking before the age of 15   [03:58,0]
- dar moqāyese bā digar nojavānān , haštād darsad ehtemāl bālātar masraf mavād qeyr qānuni rā dāštand.	 [04:00,8]
    were 80% more likely to use illegal drugs than those who didn't.   [04:00,8]
- va motāle`e ey dar sāl do hezār va haft be in yāfte rasid ke nojavānān beyn davāzdah tā hefdah sāle ey ke sigār kešidand ,	 [04:05,0]
    And a 2007 study found that teenagers between 12 and 17 who smoked   [04:05,0]
- se barābar ehtemāl bištari dārad ke betor efrāti alkel masraf kanand ,	 [04:10,4]
    were three times more likely to binge drink,   [04:10,4]
- haft barābar ehtemāl bištari dārad ke mavādi mesl hero`in yā kukāyin rā masraf karde bāšand ,	 [04:13,0]
    seven times more likely to have used drugs like heroin or cocaine,   [04:13,0]
- va hamčenin haft barābar ehtemāl bištar gerāyeš be mārijāvān rā dārand.	 [04:16,8]
    and were also seven times more likely to resort to marijuana.   [04:16,8]
- va^li a^gar čenin bāšad ,	 [04:21,5]
    But if that's the case,   [04:21,5]
- qānuni kardan mavād čegune mey tavānad az masraf mavād xatarnākatr jelogiri kanad.	 [04:23,1]
    how could making more drugs legal stop the use of hard drugs?   [04:23,1]
- ebtedā mohem ast in rā dar nazar begirim ke ؛	 [04:27,8]
    At first, it's important to acknowledge that   [04:27,8]
- mordam mavād rā be dalil qānuni yā qeyr qānuni budneš masraf nemi kanand.	 [04:30,3]
    people don't use drugs because they're legal or not.   [04:30,3]
- har māde ey ke bexāhid bexarid ,	 [04:33,1]
    If you want to buy any drug,   [04:33,1]
- hamiše mitevānid kasi rā peydā mey kanid ke moštāq ast ān rā be šomā beforušad.	 [04:35,0]
    you'll always find someone happy to sell.   [04:35,0]
- so`āl vāqe`i inset ke aslan čarā mordam	 [04:37,3]
    The real question is why do people develop   [04:37,3]
- rābete ey nāsālem bā mavād peydā mey kanand ?	 [04:40,2]
    an unhealthy relationship with drugs at all?   [04:40,2]
- motāle`āt nešān mey dahad ke šarāyet mo`ini	 [04:43,4]
    Studies show that certain conditions   [04:43,4]
- afrād rā besiyār mosta`ed masraf mavād va e`teyā` mey kanad.	 [04:45,3]
    make people especially vulnerable to drugs and addiction.   [04:45,3]
- dorān kudaki saxt ,	 [04:49,0]
    A difficult childhood,   [04:49,0]
- zarbe ravāni dar senin pāyin ,	 [04:50,6]
    early trauma,   [04:50,6]
- jāygāh ejtemā`i pāyin ,	 [04:51,7]
    low social status,   [04:51,7]
- afsordegi , va hati fāktruhāye ženetiki.	 [04:53,6]
    depression, even genetic factors.   [04:53,6]
- i^nke be kodām māde mo`tād mey šavand , dar bištar mavāred tasādofi ast.	 [04:56,4]
    Which drug they get addicted to is more often than not a matter of chance.   [04:56,4]
- mo`tāde`ān az mavād barā^ye farār kardan az moštolkān estefāde mey kanand.	 [05:02,5]
    Addicts take drugs to escape their problems.   [05:02,5]
- omā mavād noh tanhā hič kodām az moštolkān rā hal nemi kanad ,	 [05:05,5]
    But drugs don't solve any of those problems,   [05:05,5]
- balke xodaš yahi moškel jadid mey šavad.	 [05:08,0]
    and instead become a new problem.   [05:08,0]
- va^li mojāzāt afrād bexātere rušehāy nāsālemi ke barā^ye movājehe bā moškelāt entexāb kardand ,	 [05:10,2]
    But punishing people for their unhealthy coping mechanisms   [05:10,2]
- az nazar sabab šenāxti čizi rā taqyir nemi dahad.	 [05:14,0]
    doesn't change anything about the underlying causes either.   [05:14,0]
- az in ru barxi mey guyand bāyad masiri kāmelan motafāvet rā etāzx kord.	 [05:17,4]
    So some argue we need to take a completely different route.   [05:17,4]
- dar sāl do hezār va yek ,	 [05:21,7]
    In 2001,   [05:21,7]
- kešvar porteqāl ye^ki az badtarin mo`zalahāyeq masraf mavād rā dar orupā dāšt.	 [05:23,2]

- ānqadr darmānde šode budand ke ruši qeyremote`āref rā emtehān kardand :	 [05:26,1]
    So it was desperate enough to try something radical:   [05:26,1]
- az mālekit va masraf hame no` mavād maxdar jorm zodāyi šod.	 [05:29,7]
    Possession and use of all illegal drugs was decriminalized.   [05:29,7]
- digar šomā rā dastgir nemi kardand ؛	 [05:33,9]
    You would no longer be arrested;   [05:33,9]
- dar avaz , qānungozārān kampeyn salāmati bozorgi be rāh āndāxtand.	 [05:35,6]
    instead, authorities launched a major health campaign.   [05:35,6]
- kasāni rā ke bā meqdār kami mavād mey gereftand ,	 [05:39,4]
    People who were found with a small amount   [05:39,4]

    were referred to support services,   [05:41,5]
- ke dar ānjā xadamāt darmāni va kāheš xatar daryāft mey kardand.	 [05:43,4]
    and got help with treatment and harm reduction.   [05:43,4]
- masraf mavād be češm yek bimāri mozman dide mišod , noh yek jorm.	 [05:45,9]
    Drug use was seen as a chronic disease, not a crime.   [05:45,9]
- natāyej xire konande bud :	 [05:50,1]
    The results were stunning:   [05:50,1]
- te`dād efrādi ke mavād rā emtehān karde va masraf rā edāme dādand	 [05:52,1]
    the number of people who tried drugs and kept using them   [05:52,1]
- az čehl va čāhār darsad be bist va heštan darsad dar sāl do hezār va davāzdah kāheš yāft.	 [05:55,3]
    fell from 44% to 28% by 2012.   [05:55,3]
- masraf mavād xatarnākatr kamtar šod ,	 [05:59,6]
    The use of hard drugs decreased,   [05:59,6]
- va hamčenin mavāred urdomovār , ebtelā be HIV va hepātit.	 [06:01,9]
    as well as HIV & hepatitis infections and overdoses.   [06:01,9]
- šā^yad qānuni kardan mavād dar majmu` bištar az āsibi mizand , be jāme`e komak kanad.	 [06:06,2]
    Making drugs legal might overall help society much more than it harms it.   [06:06,2]
- estedlāl šomāre se :	 [06:13,0]
    Argument number 3:   [06:13,0]
- mārijāvān e`tiyādāvār va nāsālem ast.	 [06:15,0]
    Marijuana is addictive and unhealthy.   [06:15,0]
- lāzem ast qeyreqānuni bemānd tā āsib dar kamtarin sath bāšad.	 [06:17,7]
    It needs to remain illegal to keep harm at a minimum.   [06:17,7]
- agarče e`teyā` be mārijāvān bištar ravāni ast tā fiziki ,	 [06:21,9]
    While marijuana addiction is more psychological than physical,   [06:21,9]
- bā in vojud mas`ale ey jadisot.	 [06:25,7]
    it is still a real problem.   [06:25,7]
- taqāzā barā^ye darmān e`teyā` be mārijāvān	 [06:27,5]
    The demand for treatment for marijuana addiction   [06:27,5]
- tanhā dar dahe gozašte biš az do barābar šode ast.	 [06:30,4]
    has more than doubled in the past decade alone.   [06:30,4]
- va dar kol , hudud dah darsad kasāni ke mārijāvān rā emtehān mey kanand , be ān mo`tād mey šavand.	 [06:33,4]
    In total, about 10% of people who try marijuana will become addicted.   [06:33,4]
- in mas`ale be maqādir bālātar THC ham marbut ast.	 [06:38,3]
    This is also related to higher THC levels.   [06:38,3]
- motāle`e ey ke dar sāl do hezār va hefdah montašer šod ,	 [06:41,9]
    A study released in 2017   [06:41,9]

    physical health problems, except for a higher risk of gum disease.   [07:06,0]

- omā va^qti motāle`āt jadidolti nušidan alkel va sigār kešidan rā ham be hesāb āvardand ,	 [07:16,0]
    but when more recent studies took drinking and smoking into account,   [07:16,0]
- yāfte hā be natije ey qat`i narasidand.	 [07:19,7]
    the results were inconclusive.   [07:19,7]
- rahiroftem , tahqyqāt nešān dāde ke	 [07:23,1]
    Overall, research shows that   [07:23,1]
- masraf har no` mavādi dar dore ey ke maqz dar hāl šekl giri ast , zarar dārad.	 [07:24,6]
    taking any drugs while the brain is still in development is bad for you.   [07:24,6]
- omā haqiqat inset ke , hanuz nemi dānim mārijāvān čeqadr nāsālem bāšad.	 [07:29,6]

    We need more funding for research,   [07:34,0]

- kasi az i^nke sigār va alkel qānuni hastand natije nemi girad ke bi zarar hastand.	 [08:07,8]
    Nobody is suggesting tobacco and alcohol are harmless just because they're legal.   [08:07,8]
- alāve bar in , hičkas be tor jadi peygir mamnu`it ānhā nist , bā i^nke har do besiyār xatarnāk hastand.	 [08:12,8]
    Also, nobody is seriously proposing to prohibit them even though they are extremely dangerous.   [08:12,8]
- qānuni kardan dar vāqe` rāhi barā^ye dāštan hadi az kontorol ravi ānhāst ,	 [08:19,0]

- banābarin qānuni kardan mārijāvān be ma`nāy hemāyat az ān nist.	 [08:44,0]
    So making marijuana legal doesn't mean endorsing it.   [08:44,0]
- balke be ma`nāy be ohde gereftan mas`uliyat xatrāti ast ke ijād mey kanad.	 [08:47,4]
    It means taking responsibility for the risks it poses.   [08:47,4]
- hamčenin āzādrāh hāyi barā^ye hezārān tahqyqāt jadid bāz mey kanad ,	 [08:51,1]

    Marijuana is a drug,   [09:01,5]
